            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the LADIES of our Times.</head>
            <p>IT was the paſſage of an able <hi>Pen, That to deſcribe a Holy State, without a virtuous Lady,

            <p>Some there are (I confeſs) who have an Itch to ſet down your <hi>Crimes,</hi> rather then your <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi> They ſay you are the <hi>Syrens</hi> of the Earth, which cauſe ſhipwrack without water; and if you but ſtep awry, they look on you [preſently] as a <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Eclipſe;</hi> they cry out, <hi>Omne malum fere ex Gyneſio, Women are uſually the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the faireſt <hi>Beauty</hi> is not without ſome <hi>Cloud.</hi> And I ſhall no way deſire to strike at your <hi>Vices,</hi> by ſlandering your <hi>Sex;</hi> it ſavouring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:170557:3"/>of <hi>Paſſion</hi> then <hi>Charity,</hi> to blame the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for the defects of <hi>Particulars.</hi> Though too many there are (indeed) who follow the ſteps of the firſt <hi>VVoman,</hi> and abandon themſelves to Luxury, vanity, and diſſolute Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>But what? though <hi>Dinah will be gadding abroad, and ſay it is to viſit the Daughters, though it be to entangle and to be taken by the men of the Land?</hi> Do we not find three <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> at the foot of the Croſs humble and mortified? What though <hi>Pride,</hi> the eldest Daughter of this fair Mother <hi>[Beauty]</hi> ſeldome begets the beſt <hi>Houſe-wives,</hi> yet how many Women are there, truly Divine, who ſhine in their <hi>Houſes</hi> like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Stars,</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> in his <hi>Orb.</hi> And he that would equal their worth, ſhall rather find inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in his purpoſe, then want of merit in the <hi>Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo gives us a large deſcription of a virtuous Woman, <hi>Eccleſ. 6.</hi> perpetually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on good works, travelling inceſſantly [like Bees] from their <hi>Birth,</hi> and loſing no time, but to give it unto God; <hi>Devotion</hi> being the firſt Portion which he hath granted them; whereas, were they never ſo well compoſed, had they all the <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> which a heart could deſire, or the imagination feign, it would be but like ſome cruel Creature, whom nature had lodged in a <hi>painted houſe,</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:170557:3"/>like a <hi>Caſe</hi> covered with precious <hi>Stones,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Dunghil.</p>
            <p>And for your incouragement in the wayes of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> how many eminent <hi>Patterns</hi> could I lay before you, whom <hi>Hiſtories</hi> have hardly ſcope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to commend, and who appear to the world like a bluſhing <hi>Morning,</hi> which riſeth the more fair after a <hi>ſhower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh what a wealthy <hi>Exchequer</hi> of true <hi>Beauties,</hi> what a ſpacious <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of heavenly minded <hi>Lovers,</hi> do we find in the ſacred Scriptures? what a <hi>rich Mine</hi> of coſtly <hi>Jewels</hi> may we there behold? Shall I ſhew you the Humility of the <hi>Maries,</hi> the Faith of <hi>Sara,</hi> the upright and blameleſs <hi>walking</hi> in the commandments of God of <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> Shall I preſent you with a <hi>Dorcas, fruitful in good works;</hi> a <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> heavenly in <hi>diſcourſe;</hi> a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> whoſe <hi>heart</hi> was opened; a <hi>Berſheba, Lois, Eunice,</hi> careful to teach their Children in the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I tell you of the great Woman of <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 4.9.10. verſ. 23. Act. 16.13.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170557:4"/>And (as if <hi>Innocency</hi> were never better lodged then at the <hi>ſign</hi> of <hi>Labour,</hi> Idleneſs being the ſource of embroiling the <hi>Spirits;</hi> do we not find the wiſeſt of men further deſcribing a <hi>virtuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> by the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> ſhe holds forth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of her <hi>Family.</hi> And if we look upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> we ſhall find <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> [the Founder of <hi>Empires</hi>] not reputing the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Needle, &amp; ſuch kind of employments, unworthy of his <hi>Daughters.</hi> And the <hi>Romans</hi> much more preferring (as a <hi>Relick</hi>) the <hi>Diſtaff</hi> of Queen <hi>Tanaquilla,</hi> then the Lance or Sword of <hi>Romulus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You <hi>(Ladies)</hi> then that conſume your <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Time,</hi> in Painting, Powdering, Perfuming, and adorning your ſelves with ſuch other <hi>Actings,</hi> as if Death and Love had conſpired to make their <hi>feaſt</hi> in one and the ſame <hi>place;</hi> you who complain if the leaſt beam pierce through a little hole of your <hi>Fan,</hi> or if a Fly chance to light upon it. You (who if a Hair be but amiſs) preſently call a <hi>Council</hi> for the reforming thereof. Oh conſider! that ſuch <hi>vanities</hi> conclude not your happineſs; But the perfections of your <hi>Sex</hi> end in wiſdom, and the fear of God, which is the firſt and laſt Ornament.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo, how ſuddenly the <hi>Scene</hi> in the <hi>Maſque</hi> will be altered; what then will become of your <hi>Shops</hi> of <hi>vanity,</hi> thoſe ſuperfluous <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170557:4"/>and that long <hi>Inventory</hi> of Ladies Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, which made the <hi>Gates of the City to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourn,</hi> Iſai. <hi>3.11.</hi> Iſai. <hi>3.18.21.</hi> and which (ſince that day) have been increaſed amongſt you by modern <hi>Faſhion-mongers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Age,</hi> will one day wither the Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of your <hi>youth,</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> davers the freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Roſes</hi> and <hi>Lillies.</hi> Spend ſome time then, more then for the Body, Pride, and Earth. Let not your thoughts ſtrike ſail to <hi>Affection,</hi> nor your hearts do homage to that which will enſnare and impriſon you in the Fetters of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Do you know how ſpeedily the <hi>Storms</hi> of an evil <hi>Conſcience</hi> may trouble the ſerenity of your <hi>delights,</hi> and the ſeeming tranquillity of your <hi>Affections?</hi> the beſt of our <hi>Joyes</hi> here, being but <hi>fires</hi> of ſtraw, or flattering <hi>Sun-ſhines,</hi> which are either ſuddenly waſhed away with a ſhower, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed by a <hi>Tempeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labour then to ſupply your natural <hi>defects,</hi> with the <hi>virtues</hi> of your mind. Read conſtant <hi>Lectures</hi> of your own mortality. Thoſe <hi>Flowers</hi> are beſt, and ſweeteſt, which grow in the Garden, and not in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Adam,</hi> was never more beautiful then when he was in his Innocency, and free from gaudineſs: and we find <hi>Solomons</hi> Spouſe, <hi>all glorious within,</hi> and needs no outward <hi>Ornaments</hi> to make her amiable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170557:5"/>Oh think not then on <hi>Religion,</hi> as upon ſome fearful <hi>Apparition,</hi> whoſe <hi>viſage</hi> is ſo fair and lovely.

You ſay nothing is more raviſhing then <hi>Beauty,</hi> and can you he better delighted then in the higheſt <hi>Beauty</hi> of your <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, that you may the better behold that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Oyntment which drops down from the head of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> into the <hi>Souls</hi> of his <hi>Saints,</hi> you ſhall there find that there is a Chamber within us, and a bed of Love in that Chamber, wherein Chriſt meets, and reſts with the <hi>Soul.</hi> O ſweet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! whereby we are alſo made the Temples of the Comforter himſelf; and in which communion ſtands the fulneſs of joy and <hi>beauty.</hi> Here the more you love, the more you may.

            <p>Here may you confer with the infinite <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and (with joy) often repeat the unſpeakable <hi>Bounties</hi> of your Saviour, far beyond all thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous <hi>Imaginations</hi> which <hi>Poets</hi> feign, and idle wits have fram'd <hi>Errant Ladies</hi> to have engag'd their <hi>Servants</hi> in.

            <p>Ah the pleaſantneſs of ſuch a life of <hi>Love!</hi> Then onely indeed [and not till then] do we live when we injoy <hi>divine Love;</hi> Nor can our boſoms breathe out the breath of <hi>life,</hi> before Chriſt breathes in us the breath of <hi>Love!</hi> Alas! what Dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>The Epiſtle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THat which is moſt pleaſing to the Soul and nature of man [next unto <hi>God</hi>] is <hi>Love;</hi> the generall <hi>ſubject</hi> of this whole Work is <hi>Love;</hi> and the ſeveral parts thereof, tending to the better ordering of a Godly, morall, and civil life.</p>
            <p>To tell many of a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> beyond what Senſe feels, is a Myſtery which they can neither perceive, nor believe. Many (indeed) can ſpend dayes and weeks in reading the fond <hi>Fancies</hi> of ilde <hi>Lovers,</hi> but have not an hour to meditate on the love of God. Oh! how often are we ſinged in the flames of that late <hi>Love,</hi> which cannot hold without jealouſies, nor break without <hi>Repentance!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange weakneſs of judgement, that our eyes ſhould be ſo enflamed in the violent purſuits of worldly <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> ſince the worlds beſt <hi>Jewels</hi> [though followed by a million of Idolaters] are but like the empty Imaginations of a ſick Spirit; and he that too eagerly Courts them, its twenty to one but he periſhes in their <hi>Embraces.</hi> Nay, is it not madneſs out-right, that our eyes ſhould reſerve to themſelves no other <hi>Objects,</hi> then ſuch thin <hi>colours,</hi> which put upon them ſo many <hi>Illuſions,</hi> to occaſion our miſery; and (like ſo many dangerous Snakes) lie lurking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the green leaves of ſugred Speeches, and fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions; and which (unleſs we timely reſiſt their influence) will at laſt lead us into irrecoverable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170557:7"/>Our bleſſed Lord, met the young man carried to be buried, at the Town of <hi>Naim,</hi> which [being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, the Town of <hi>Beauties</hi>] may ſhew us how ſoon the glory thereof fadeth; and how dangerous it is, paſſionately to affect the <hi>objects</hi> of the world (which never giveth us fine <hi>Ware,</hi> but pincheth it, either in the meaſure, or continuance) ſeeing we cannot but with abundance of griefe, loſe all that which with unlimited Love is poſſeſſed. So ſubtilly doth Satan ſound our inclinations, and diſcover our Diſpoſitions, as that he intermedleth, and layeth <hi>ſnares</hi> in all things wherein he obſerveth us with moſt fervour and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs to be buſied.</p>
            <p>And muſt not every judicious man, needs be in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſs (through the ſole conſideration of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that the moſt noble <hi>Loves</hi> [yea, the greateſt] ought to be employed in things inviſible? For what are all the <hi>Glories</hi> of the World, but Towers, and Columnes of <hi>Dirt,</hi> plaiſtered over with Gold, and the deceitful <hi>varniſh</hi> of fading <hi>Pleaſures?</hi> whoſe amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſſaults will at laſt prove but like Rocks of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, Fountains which ſend forth poiſoned Streams, and Trees whoſe fruit will be bitter in the <hi>ſtomack,</hi> how pleaſing ſoever it be in the <hi>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Carnall Souls [I confeſs] have much ado to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how any man can become paſſionate in the love of God. They know no affectation but for <hi>temporall</hi> and viſible <hi>things. O blinded ſpirits!</hi> ignorant of the Myſteries of Heaven! a Country wherein you have no commerce. How wretched (alas!) are your loves, which dote on the fading <hi>Beauties</hi> and vanity of the World? ſince you Idolize a little exterior skin, which
<pb facs="tcp:170557:7"/>being pull'd off, you will take that for a <hi>Monſter,</hi> which you now adore for a <hi>Goddeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary; vve find the holy Scripture [ſpeaking of <hi>Love</hi>] to ſay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.3. <hi>That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth one Soul to claſpe into another!</hi> If once you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to love <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> you will think upon him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every moment. Every time you fetch breath (ſaith St. <hi>Gregory</hi>) there will come a pleaſing <hi>Idea</hi> of God, to fill your Soul vvith Comfort and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Ah! hovv vvill you feel diſtaſte, and unſavorineſs of heart, againſt all Earthly things! yea, the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>objects</hi> of the vvorld, vvill then ſeem mingled vvith Gall and Wormvvood; you will ſeek for <hi>Jeſus</hi> in all <hi>Creatures;</hi> you vvill ſpeak of him in all <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi> yea, you will earneſtly deſire to ſee him honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſteemed, and acknovvledged by all the World. Your Solitude vvill be in him; your <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of him; <hi>Jeſus</hi> vvill be in your Watchings, and in your Sleep, in your Recreations, and all your <hi>Affairs;</hi> and you vvill account it your greateſt miſery, to loſe ſight of him but for one hour.</p>
            <p>Go then (fond <hi>Lover!</hi>) and ſee the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of thoſe vvho have been burnt in the <hi>Flames</hi> of the worlds love, and thou ſhalt find nothing anſwerable to this Love. Here maiſt thou ſilence all thy trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Thoughts, all thy inordinate <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which ſo often bereave thee of thy Saviours preſence. Here maiſt thou appeaſe the ſtormes, and troubles of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried life, and ſilently ſpeak unto him. Here maiſt thou <hi>Allegorize</hi> all earthly <hi>Vanities</hi> into heavenly <hi>Truths.</hi> Here maiſt thou find the Pilgrimage of a perfect
<pb facs="tcp:170557:8"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> following his Saviour home to the <hi>Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, Here maiſt thou be wrapt in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his <hi>Bounties,</hi> and raviſht in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>Beauties;</hi> It having been my deſire, and endeavour (by ſetting forth the Vanities of the World, and the <hi>Excellencies,</hi> and Riches which are in Chriſt) to draw the heart of his <hi>Spouſe</hi> to be <hi>ſick of Love</hi> to him, and to be enflamed with longings to enjoy him, until by the ſacred ardors of love, he dive into our hearts, and make us enter with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great Abyſs of delights, which he hath reſerved for the moſt purified Souls.</p>

            <p>See how a ſenſeleſs <hi>ſoul</hi> (like a lazie <hi>Pilot,</hi> or one faſt aſleep in the midſt of the <hi>Sea,</hi> being oppreſſed with drowſineſs, and having loſt his Helm) deludeth it ſelf!

            <p>The moſt generous ſpirit becomes a <hi>Captive,</hi> when this tempting, and imperious viſage, and <hi>Commandreſs</hi> comes and knocks at the door of his heart.

            <p>Neither is it to be wondred at what the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the too free familiarity with Women, was a firebrand in the boſome;</hi> Prov. 6.27. and as another ſaid, <hi>It was as eaſie to live among burning coals, as to converſe with this Sex, and not to wound the ſoul.</hi> How careful then ſhould we be to avoid whatſoever may endanger the ſcortching, not only of our <hi>Body,</hi> but our precious <hi>Soul:</hi> yea, how ſhould we fear our <hi>Relapſes,</hi> and ſhun all occaſions which may re-enkindle the <hi>flame.</hi>

               <p>And ſure, it imports us much to fight valiantly, and to bring with us the hearts of <hi>Lions:</hi> what honour can we expect by yeilding to the firſt Temptation?

               </head>
               <p>ALL things here below being tranſitory and frail, little is the ſupport we can find in them, until God hath poured his <hi>holy Love</hi> into our heart, which can alone purifie our life, and eternize our <hi>Souls.</hi> It is he which inſpireth the love with which he will be loved: It is his gift alone by which we love him above all, and all for him. God in the firſt place gives us a taſte of his Word, and makes us to taſte ſweetneſs therein; and he only it is who gives us good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards the amendment of our life.</p>
               <p>Conſider then (O Soul! redeemed with the blood of the Son of God) that thou canſt not live without <hi>Love;</hi> ſince on what ſide ſoever thou turneſt, thou muſt neceſſarily love; and God (who is the Author of Love, and makes of the lightnings thereof, erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby to communicate himſelf to man) ſeeing this neceſſity, would that thou take the <hi>object</hi> of his love, for the <hi>object</hi> of thy own, who is altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither is there ſpot or blemiſh in him.</p>
               <p>And (O my ſoul!) when thou haſt heedfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated his <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſtrive to finde a reciprocal love enkindled in thy <hi>breaſt</hi> towards him, who loved thee, when there was nothing lovely in thee; who made no love to <hi>Beauties,</hi> to gold, or greatneſs, but loved thy very poverty and miſeries.</p>
               <p>From this Love it is, that we are diligent and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous in praying to him; that we endeavour the keeping of our Conſcience unſpotted, that <hi>ſin</hi> is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170557:14"/>weakned, his Law obſerved, our luſts abated; that humane conſiderations, and all the reſpects of fleſh and blood are trod under foot; yea, that we account all things worſe then a <hi>Dunghil, to gain Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Hence further it is, that we are patient in adverſities, that we embrace the Croſs, that we love our enemies, and do good to thoſe that perſecute us.</p>
               <p>Behold the accompliſhment alſo of true love, left us in the <hi>pattern</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour, who made himſelf the higheſt example thereof, in laying down his life to ſave us. Few there are, who in an unſhaken conſtancy perſevere till death: we read indeed of ſtrange examples of Amity and Affection between

                  </gap>ut his deareſt <hi>Friend</hi> on his ſhoulders; of another, who gave his own eyes for the ranſom of him he tenderly affected.</p>
               <p>We finde mention alſo of many Women, tyed with the indiſſoluble chains of vertuous inclinations: As <hi>Valeria,</hi> who ſaid, Though her husband were dead to others, he was not ſo to her. Of <hi>Sulpitia,</hi> who (in ſpite of her Mother) broke doors and locks to run after her baniſhed Husband. Of <hi>Eponina,</hi> many years ſhut up with her Husband in a hollow <hi>Tomb.</hi> Of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Queen, who in the midſt of all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, followed him through ſnows, ſtorms, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes. But eſpecially of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> [that mirrour of Love, and ardent affection] whoſe ſoul diſſolved and melted with ſpiritual languor, on the heart of her beloved Saviour.</p>
               <p>We read alſo of ſome who have licked whole the envenomed wounds of their Husbands, who have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170557:15"/>breathed out their laſt upon the Graves of thoſe who firſt gave them heart and affections; and of thoſe who have forſaken all their friends, renounced their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and expoſed themſelves to the greateſt hazards envie or time could bring upon them. But alas! ſaith the poor ſoul, what is all this, if heaped together, to the love of my Saviour? How far is it from that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical love? How ſmall a drop to that Deluge of his myſterious and adorable love?</p>
               <p>Now thoſe that deſire to profit in this love, muſt by fervent prayer beg it of God, they muſt value and eſteem it above all earthly things, and apply all their actions thereunto, ſince it will no way be entertained in a ſoul ſullyed with worldly and terreſtrial <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> They muſt render him fervency and earneſtneſs in all their meditations and devotion; no hour muſt paſs without ſome <hi>ejaculation;</hi> in all companies we muſt publiſh his greatneſs: we muſt refer all <hi>objects,</hi> all creatures to his love, and love nothing but in him, and for him; yea, we muſt engrave all his words, wounds, and actions in the bottom of our hear.</p>
               <p>And O that we could often preſent unto our ſelves (as the principal means whereby we may come to this heavenly obedience) that infinite love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> Oh that we could here be raiſed on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Region of Grace, and poize our ſelves on the wings of Faith, there being no tongue ſo eloquent, no pen ſo learned, ſufficiently to expreſs it. But oh the deadneſs and dulneſs of our ſpirits! Could we but here reflect, and a little lift up our eyes [ſurcharged with ſo many earthly humours and vanities] to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that preſident which he hath given for the rule
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170557:15"/>of our Love, What ſecrets? What myſteries of love ſhould we there finde? What greatneſs and purity muſt we needs conceive therein? And oh how much ſhame ought we then to have, ſo to defile our love with the impurities of the earth?</p>
               <p>This, this alone, is it which hath made many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the ſhaddows of <hi>Diadems,</hi> and Scepters, which ſo eaſily deceive the credulity of the moſt paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ambitious,</hi> by their fond illuſions, and have thereby attain'd Renown on earth, and a <hi>Crown</hi> in heaven. Theſe are Celeſtial <hi>fires,</hi> which ever proceed from God, as being their proper <hi>Sphere.</hi> It is he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth them, and breedeth them; being no way conſtrained to deſcend upon earth, to ſeek nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from periſhing creatures.</p>
               <p>Thoſe (indeed) which ſeek nothing in the world, but ſenſual pleaſures, which are more thin then ſmoak, and lighter then Wind, cannot imagine how much theſe fair <hi>amities</hi> (which are the daughters of Vertues) nouriſh holy delights. The love of God (ſaith one) is an influence of <hi>Eternity,</hi> becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an Eternal God. It is rather inſpired, then ſtudied: It is given to us by the favour of heaven. Though good Books and Diſcourſes contribute much to this purpoſe, yet they who think to learn the love of God only by precepts, have little in them that is ſolid.</p>
               <p>And thoſe <hi>Lovers</hi> who have the ardours of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who entertain chaſte and ſpiritual love for things divine, partake of thoſe pleaſures which the <hi>jealous</hi> eye cannot eſpye, the ſlanderous <hi>tongue</hi> cannot hite: And when we thus love God, we finde him every
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170557:16"/>where, we ſerve him every where, and every where meet with the recompence of our ſervices: we may <hi>Jonah</hi> (with <hi>Jonah</hi>) cry unto him out of the <hi>Whales</hi> 2.2. <hi>Belly,</hi> as from a <hi>Chappel;</hi> and talk with him (with the <hi>three children</hi> in the midſt of <hi>flames, Dan.</hi> 3.25. Surely, to love truly, is to love aloft, and to love him who made us; when once we are come thus far, we ſhall finde all the greatneſs of the world lower then our feet.</p>
               <p>Let us not then put a <hi>Balm</hi> ſo precious, into an unclean Veſſel: Let us retain no <hi>Idols,</hi> or paſſions in our hearts, to oppoſe or withſtand this excellent <hi>Gueſt.</hi> Let us entertain this Love with all the ſtrength and vigour of our heart and ſoul, yea, make it our continual practice.</p>
               <p>Shall we ſet our <hi>Affections</hi> ſo eagerly on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable and inconſiderable affairs of the world? Shall we ſlight a matter of ſo great importance as the love of God? Shall worldly <hi>Lovens</hi> eſpouſe all occaſions, uſe all ways and diligence, transform themſelves into all ſhapes and humours; paſs through fire, ice, tears, blood, fearful Torrents, enraged Seas, enflamed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, to attain their hearts wiſh, and arive at the leaſt of their <hi>deſires,</hi> and pretenſions; and ſhall not we with the greateſt applications of minde and ſoul, uſe all poſſible induſtry to profit in a more divine and heavenly Love?</p>
               <p>O ſhameful reproach! That all this ſhould be done for a vain and worldly love, which ends always in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and endangers our ſouls; and there is none but <hi>Jeſus</hi> [who is chiefly to be loved] for whom we will not ſtir a hand or a foot! Out alas! Why are we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170557:16"/>ſo blinde as to love ſervitude, and to make a Goddeſs of the Worlds Beauties? Why ſhould we make it our glory to ſacrifice our Liberty, and kiſs the Fetters of our ſlavery?</p>
               <p>Alas! How dear doth it coſt us to deſtroy our poor <hi>ſouls?</hi> Did the man of <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> but think, that whiles he is in the <hi>embraces</hi> of his fulſome <hi>Miſtris,</hi> that his ſoul is waited on by <hi>death,</hi> and death by <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> Did he but think that thoſe eyes which did burn in <hi>Luſt,</hi> ſhould in a bottomleſs Furnace be ſcorched with Brimſtone; That thoſe ears, which here were wont to wanton it with Minſtrels, ſhall there be filled with nothing elſe but the groans of Divels, and the ſhrill ſcreetches of the damned; that the <hi>Tongue</hi> which delighted in the relation of fond and idle Stories, ſhould there cry out for water to cool it; and the whole Body, which was here clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in rich and fantaſtique garbs, ſhould be hereafter enwrapped in a mantle (at once of darkneſs, and yet) of flames; and the Voice, which here was taken up with the Songs and Ditties of Love, ſhould there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but complain of Torments: Would he (I ſay) but conſider all this, it were impoſſible, that he which thus loves pleaſure, and cannot endure to be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould delight to thruſt himſelf into the fire; or, that he which fears to loſe one drop of blood, ſhould delight in the wounding of his whole Body.</p>
               <p>Stand amazed then (O poor Soul!) and bewail thy ſelf, that thou ſhouldeſt no better value ſo ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable a favour as thy Saviours love; and reſolve for the remaining part of thy life, to be crucified unto all thoſe Objects of pleaſure, profit, and honour, which have heretofore tranſported thee!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170557:17"/>O ſweet Jeſus!

If my Eyes have been the cauſe to entertain fond love, O let them now become Veſſels of Water, to waſh away the ſpots of all unchaſte glances: If my Hairs have been Nets to captivate any ſoul under the yoke of wanton Love, O let them be trampled under feet, as the Enſigns and Standards of wicked <hi>Cupid.</hi> Let thoſe Embraces which carried nothing but the poyſon of a luxurious paſſion, now claſp him, under whoſe ſhelter I ſhall eternally reſt ſecure. Briefly, let me breathe nothing but the delicacies of Chaſtity, and let thoſe pleaſing Odours which were once vowed to ſenſuality, at laſt become the ſweeteſt exhalation of odoriferous perſume at the Altar of my Saviour; that ſo I may practiſe a ſanctified revenge on my ſelf, and my Repentance never end but with my life.</p>

               <p>SO many and great are the delights and entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Fleſh, the Divel, and the World, to withdraw man's love from God, as that he hath not only imprinted in his heart, that he was ſolely to love his Creator; but ſuch was his infinite goodneſs [to the end man might never forget it] as to leave him his ſpiritual Law, written in Tables of Stone, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170557:17"/>thy ſoul, and with all thy might,</hi> Deut. 6. Neither do we finde any Law or Precept ſo ſtrongly and largely enjoyn'd, as this; binding the heart, tongue, hand, eyes, and the faculties of our ſoul to love God.</p>
               <p>How then can we anſwer our own Soul without bluſhing here, or without confuſion or condemnation at the laſt day? Or, can we render any thing leſs then love? Can any price be ſet too high for ſo infinite a ranſome, whereby both ſoul and body [forfeited by our ſins to Satan, and eternal Hell fire] are freed, through the ſhameful tortures, the diſgraceful uſage, and cruel murthering of a merciful Saviour?</p>
               <p>Had God (as juſtly he might) in return of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, commanded thee to offer unto him all thy Wealth, to ſacrifice all thy Children (as ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then have done, and) as once he tempted <hi>Abraham.</hi> Had he required thee with ſtripes and faſtings, to mortifie and kill thy body. Had he commanded boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the poor, the poor man might have ſaid, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give it: If labour or faſting, the ſick and infirm, (or if knowledge, the ſimple) might have ſaid, I have them not in my power. But if in lieu of all this, he require only that which is the leaſt <hi>[thy love]</hi> and which without expence, pain, or labour, thou mayeſt eaſily afford, O my ſoul! How canſt thou make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purchaſe, then (by love) to make God, Heaven, and Earth to be wholly thine?</p>
               <p>All that God Courts and Wooes man for, is his <hi>Heart;</hi> Prov. 23.26. and wilt thou not grant him this deſire, O my ſoul? He might have required all thy ſubſtance, all thy actions, to be ſpent in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice, and worſhip. He grants thee thy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170557:18"/>wealth, and the fruits of thy honeſt labour, and bids thee give only what thou canſt beſt ſpare of all thy Increaſe; he takes only a Tenth, and from all thy worldly labours only a ſevonth part; Love, and the affection of thy heart being all that he entirely calls for.</p>
               <p>Thy bleſſed Saviour ſo highly valued this Treaſure of love, as that (even then when he was to depart and leave the world) he left it [as his laſt Will and Teſtament] to his Diſciples, and that, <hi>as he had loved them, ſo they ſhould love one another,</hi> John 13.34. Ah! ſaith he (being at the laſt point, as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Poſſion) to his Diſciples [and in them to us] my time is but ſhort, and I finde death approaching, before which, I have one only remembrance to give you, <hi>That you love one another.</hi> It was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he deſired them, that, <hi>If they did love him, they would keep his Commandments:</hi> Love being as it were the Embaſſadour of God, and hath not only proclaimed the <hi>Fulfilling of the Law,</hi> (Rom. 13.10.) but (as our Saviour himſelf pronounced) <hi>thereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Law, and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O then (my God! my <hi>Jeſus!</hi>) make me to keep the Law of thy Love, and nothing elſe: Thy love is a yoke which brings with it more honour then burden: It is a yoke that hath no wearineſs in it. O my ſweet Saviour; My ſoul is weary, and greatly diſtaſted with all the fading delights of this tranſitory world, and doth inceſſantly languiſh after thee! Shew me then my ſtains, and give me water to waſh them out. Let the night ceaſe to caſt a dark Vail over my mortal body; but let the Sun be advanced high, and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170557:18"/>break of day begin to guild the mountains, where my Soul hovereth, and is aſhamed to ſee its ſelf ſo dark before light, and ſmutted over before thy immortal whiteneſs. Alas! I am altogether but one ſtain, and thou art all purity; do not [however] write me on the ground, as a childe of the earth, but write me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſince I am the portion which thou haſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thy precious blood.</p>
               <p>Thy love is the Center of all our true love, on which our heart (as on the point of a Compaſs) being ſet, the other part moves about the Circumference of the World. Is it not the Almighty, whoſe mercies are without number? Where hath it been well with us without him? Or, How can it be ill with us where he is preſent? <hi>I had rather</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>be a Pilgrim here on earth with him, then be in heaven without him.</hi> And bleſſed then ſure are they, who delight to attend his ſervice, and caſt from him all the fetters and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of worldly love.</p>
               <p>For what will all things avail, if we be forſaken of our Creatour? Can we live without the Fountain of Life? All places are ſolitary where he is not; and where he is, there only is fulneſs of pleaſure. O <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus!</hi> the author of all Glories, henceforth be unto me my only Crown! For, oh how vain is the reſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of man! who (though nothing brings joy and comfort without God, and that he finds ſo little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in all worldly treaſures, as that the vanity in poſſeſſion will ſoon reprove the violence of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite) is notwithſtanding ſtill ſullying himſelf in the puddles thereof!</p>
               <p>How often do we cry out (with the perverſe Jews)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170557:19"/>not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Barrabas;</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>Mammon?</hi> How often (with the Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) do we ſay of our Covetouſneſs, Honours, Greatneſs, and the reſt of our Luſts, <hi>Ye are our Gods?</hi> whereas alas! God cannot endure that one Temple ſhould receive both his <hi>Ark</hi> and the Idol <hi>Dagon.</hi> He will not have the Divel, the Fleſh, and the World, ſhould come in and lodge in his Bed-chamber [thy heart] it being but juſt with God to require it; But oh! how unreaſonable art thou in dividing it between him, and his enemies; between <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Baal;</hi> between <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.14.</p>
               <p>Fond <hi>Worldlings!</hi> Can you be ſo great enemies to your ſouls, as (being once unlooſed from ſlavery) to ſigh, wither, and languiſh for your fetters? for ſhame then forſake the love of theſe poor Cottages, theſe fading pleaſures, theſe little Ant-hills, which enflame thy heart. Thy Country is no longer Earth, behold the great Globe of Heaven all repleniſhed with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lights; why do we ſo extreamly torment our poor life, running after this worlds ſhadows, which we cannot follow without trouble, nor poſſeſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, nor loſe without ſorrow.</p>
               <p>He that cloaths the flowers of the Meadows more gorgeouſly then Monarchs, who lodgeth ſo many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fiſhes in golden and azure ſhells: He who but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth his hand, and repleniſheth all Nature with his bleſſings, will never forſake us at our need, if we love him, and keep his Commandments. A man that muſt die, needs very few worldly things, but whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms will not ſatisfie covetouſneſs. O my God? Shall I always then fly after that which flies from me,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170557:19"/>and never follow Jeſus, who follows me, and even loves me when I am ungrateful? Ah no more let me run after the vaniſhing Beauties of a deceitful world!</p>
               <p>Our love to Jeſus ſhould be like the Needle in the Seamans Chard, which (though it be ever moving and caſting about as it were to ſeveral parts) yet it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and retains its whole ſetled courſe to the true Pole-ſtar. It ſhould be like the Oak, the Hart, and the Elephant, which (as Naturaliſts obſerve, are long liv'd, and not like Pincks, Roſes, and Tulips [flowers of ſight and ſmell, but] delightful only for a few hours.</p>
               <p>If you will examine King <hi>David</hi> (the man after Gods own heart) he will tell you, he hath conquered the <hi>Bear</hi> and the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and that great Gyant <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet was not ſatisfied: He had ſtept from a <hi>Sheep fold</hi> to a <hi>Crown,</hi> yet was not contented. He had ſubdued all his Enemies and Rebels, yet had he no reſt, until he enjoyed Heaven; <hi>I have a goodly Heritage</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but the Lord is the fulneſs of my Inheritance, in whoſe preſence there is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore;</hi> Pſal. 16. And therefore it is that he again ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>There is none O Lord, upon earth, that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We finde all ſublunary bodies compounded of the four Elements, and all the goods of the Body, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to four heads: Firſt, <hi>Life,</hi> under which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand health, ſtrength, and beauty of Body. Secondly <hi>Honour,</hi> under which may be compriſed Titles, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Priviledges, and Retinue. Thirdly, <hi>Wealth,</hi> Lands, Money, and Revenues have place. Fourthly, <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170557:20"/>which are as various as there are objects of our ſenſes, pleaſing to our taſte, ſight, touch, hearing, and ſmell. Now, though all theſe [ordinately deſired, and lawfully uſed] may be both uſeful and lawful, yet are they not able to ſatisfie the ſoul, longer then a wind or lightning. And therefore man ſhould not, (and indeed truly he cannot) ſet his love upon them.</p>
               <p>And alas! O poor ſoul! What canſt thou finde in all other loves, which prove no other then that of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who paid ſo dearly for relying on his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Dalilah;</hi> or as the Prodigals Lovers in the Goſpel, who (like Mice, Whores, and Swallows,) make love, and frequent the houſe in the Summer of proſperity; or like Lice, who continue no longer then there is ſweat to nouriſh them, but in the end, (like <hi>Actaeon</hi>'s hounds) prove your deſtroyers. The like we finde of <hi>Job's</hi> friends, and of thoſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mentions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Who loved gifts, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after Rewards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not much unlike to thoſe, were the ſeeming friends of King <hi>David,</hi> of whom he ſo often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, and prays againſt, as being of his Council, and eating his bread, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54. yet while they had butter and oyl on their lips, <hi>their hearts and tongues were ſpears, ſwords, and very poyſon:</hi> And as theſe to <hi>David</hi> were more dangerous then his publique enemies [for of thoſe (ſaith he) <hi>I could have taken heed</hi>] ſo are all the falſe Loves of Delight, Feature, Beauty, or other parts or gifts; Yea, their Loves are like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or like that creature called <hi>Acucena,</hi> which at twice handling, yeilds out an ill ſavour; or as the flowers of the Garden, which long hold neither co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour nor ſcent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170557:20"/>Ye then which cry, <hi>Come and let us crown our ſelves with Roſes, Let us eat, drink, and take our fill of love,</hi> Ah!

               <p>Sit no longer then, O my Soul! by the fire of earthly comforts, where the cold of carn I fears and ſorrows do ſtill afflict thee; Wilt thou houſe thy ſelf ſtill on worldly thoughts, and confine thy ſelf to worldly dulneſs?

               <p>GOd having concluded our ſalvation in Love, ſhews us, that the beſt and ſpeedieſt way to be happy, is to love him, who is the Author of our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and the immoveable Sun, about which ſo many changes, and agitations of all Creatures circumvolve, which continually groan, and aim at this firſt Beauty, as the true Center of everlaſting repoſe.</p>
               <p>Oh, this is the moſt aſſured way to arive to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility! It is a Treaſure which will be infinitely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, if we can tell how to attain it. It taketh hearts which (as yet) are but of earth and clay, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170557:21"/>enkindleth them with a divine flame: It beats them under the hammer of Tribulations and ſufferings, to make them fit for their Saviours reception: Yea, it makes fit veſſels of them, worthy to be placed above the chiefeſt of terrene enjoyments.</p>
               <p>We finde Love indeed divided into many branches, to wit, <hi>Natural love,</hi> which conſiſteth in things inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, having their ſympathies and antipathies; as the Amber draws the Straw; the Adamant, Iron; and as Trees and Plants bend or decline one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Next, <hi>Animal Love,</hi> is that beginning which giveth motion to the ſenſitive appetite of Beaſts, to ſee that which is fit for them, and to take pleaſure therein. <hi>Reaſonable Love,</hi> is that which ſeeketh and accepteth the good repreſented by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But alas! What are all theſe to that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Angelical Love, by whoſe ſides are lodged Beauty, and Goodneſs, which make up all loves; the ſoul of man being able no where to fix it ſelf, until it re-aſcend to God.</p>
               <p>It is the nature of Quickſilver to tremble up and down, and never leaveth, until it have found Gold, wherewith to mingle it ſelf: ſo boundeth and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart of man, here and there, in all its trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſturbances, there being nothing but Ebbs and Floods in it, until ſuch time as it is united to its Creator, as being the Temple of all repoſe.</p>
               <p>There only it is that the Baniſhed finde a Country, the Poor a Patrimony, the Ignorant Knowledge, the Feeble, Support; the Sick, Health; and the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Comfort. It is that only which immortalizeth us after death, and gives us light in our darkeſt affairs.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170557:22"/>It is that alone which is the ſanctity of all humane hearts, the comfort of our ſouls, the repoſe of life, and the knot of all felicities.</p>
               <p>And what is the cauſe that the bleſſed are never weary of loving, but that they perpetually finde in God new Beauties and Perfections. The body of man is finite, and quickly thruſts out all its qualities, which with time doth rather fade then flouriſh: but our ſoul, in ſome ſort, tendeth to infinity. Oh what ſweetneſs! Oh what an earneſt of the life of the bleſſed, is that Love which is inviolably grounded upon Vertue and Holineſs; upon heaven, and the Beauty thereof?</p>
               <p>Whereas [on the contrary] when we wax cold in the love of God, and in the exerciſe of Devotion, taking too much liberty in our converſation with ſuch things as we affect, how inſenſibly do we finde our ſelves ſurprized by the eyes, and ears, the heart, the geſture, the ſmiles, the ſpeech; yea, the whole carriage of any, who lays a Plot with our paſſion to betray our Reaſon. How do we dote, wax pale, cry to the woods and mountains, one hour we write, another we blot, then tear out all; our repaſt is unpleaſant and irkſom, and repoſe (which charmeth all the cares of the world) ſeems not made for us. So doth the poyſon of Love ſpread it ſelf over all our Veins. Abſence, unquietneſs, and diſturbance of minde, ever keeps waking the imagination. Still our <hi>fair one</hi> [ſtill our <hi>cruel one</hi>] tormenteth us, and God makes a whip for us, of that thing we moſt affect.</p>
               <p>How wretched then are thoſe poor ſouls, who ſeek for pleaſure in their affections? As that of Eloquence, of Poeſie, of Muſick, ingenious ſports, and witty jeſts,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170557:22"/>ſince theſe (though for a time ſweet to the ſenſe) are ſubject to the diverſity of Ages, Humours Seaſons, and Employments. If we conſult with Hiſtory, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of Lovers ſhall we finde, who complain of the infidelity of their Miſtreſſes, and thoſe they ſeem to adore? But the Love placed upon heavenly <hi>objects,</hi> never fails to make an anſwerable return.</p>
               <p>It is from thence that the blood is enflamed, the body weakned, the colour changed; That the eyes grow hollow, the ſenſes ſtupified, and the whole body overthrown. And though there be diverſities of Love, in ſome ſharp and violent, in others dull and cloudy, in others light and wanton, in others turbulent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and in others weak, ſoppiſh, fantaſtique, and inconſtant; yet (as if ſomthing of Idolatry adhered to it) how do all ſeem to Deifie the creature of whom they are ſo paſſionately enamoured, and would willingly place it amongſt the Sun, Stars, and Altars; yea, they would die a hundred times for it [chains, and wounds being accounted honourable] ſo it throw but ſo much as a handful of Flowers, or diſtil but one poor Tear on their Tomb.</p>
               <p>And as for affections, purely Conjugal, you ſhall finde them now adays very rare; and for Celeſtial loves, they are much more ſcarce: But for the love of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, the love of ſenſuality, of ſervitude, of fury, on what ſide ſoever you turn your face, you ſhall not fail to meet them, though nothing be beautiful, or to be affected in the beſt of them.</p>
               <p>Surely, a ſmall Circle (ſince Volumns are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) will not ſhew you the Eſſence, the Cauſes, the Symptoms, ſorts, and effects of Love; neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy

               <p>Inſomuch, that if we do but obſerve one which is transfixed with violent Love, we ſhall finde he hath all that in his love, which <hi>Divines</hi> have placed in <hi>Hell;</hi> namely, Darkneſs, Flames, the worm of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> an evil ſavour, and baniſhment from the preſence of God: He ſometimes entereth into quakings, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into faintings; one time into fits of <hi>fire,</hi> and another time into <hi>ice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I go about to fetter Love</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>it gets out of my hands; if I will judge it, it grows into favour with me; when I intend to puniſh it, it flatters me; if I will fly from it, it ſeems tied to me; when I deſtroy it with one hand, I repair it with the other; if it be too much cheriſhed, it aſſaults me more violently; if watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withers it, ſleep pampereth it; by treating it ill, I endanger my life, by pampering it too much, I incur death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly, Love enters into the moſt ſecret places, which ſeem inacceſſible, but to Spirits and Lightnings.

               <p>If Beauty then, of it ſelf, be ſo much to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it hath no other companions, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, think you is it, when Pomp of Apparel, attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, dalliances, cunning <hi>wiles,</hi> freedom of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, height of diet, courting, muſick, idleneſs, night-watchings, ſolitude, and other incitements, are joyned to it?

               </p>
               <p>And ſince fond <hi>Love</hi> thus ſets our <hi>reaſon</hi> to ſale (if it carefully take not heed) and inſenſibly draweth it to its ſide, and thereby fighteth againſt our ſelves, making uſe of our <hi>members,</hi> as of the inſtruments of its <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,</hi> and the organ of its <hi>wiles;</hi> ſince (without the ſingular grace of God) it cauſeth <hi>Sedition</hi> within, War without, and never any true repoſe: Since we have all one Domeſtick Enemy, which is our own Body, that perpetually (almoſt) oppoſeth the diſpoſitions of the ſpirit, how great ſhould be our reſiſtance? how notable our victories?</p>

               <p>Let no man then flatter you in the paſſion of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual <hi>Love,</hi> as if it were a prime vertue of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which is the <hi>ſtain</hi> that defileth all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your life: Neither, among all the qualities of a vertuous life, is there any ſweeter odour, then that Temperance which repreſſeth the voluptuous pleaſure of the body.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Love</hi> being once thus fixed, we need not fear the extravagancy thereof: With this excellent and holy temper of ſpirit it was, that <hi>Heſter</hi> changed King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> into a <hi>Lamb;</hi> that <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> was much ſtronger then the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and that the eye of <hi>Judith</hi> (triumphing over <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes,</hi> and with a little Ray of its flames, burning up a whole Army) did more then her hand, which deſtroyed 100000 men, by cutting off one only head: O what magnificent employments had Love in theſe Acts!

               </p>
               <p>We finde in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> being with rage and fury perſecuted by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> (who were thirſty for his blood) was beholding to a woman for ſhelter, and the ſupply of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as he wanted.

               <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> alſo, a man auſtere in his life, and vehement in the matters of vertue, is reported to have written letters to his dear <hi>Olimpias,</hi> from the place of his baniſhment; wherein he ſaluteth her with openneſs of moſt ardent <hi>Aeffections:</hi> He inſtructs and encourageth <hi>her</hi> by ſublime and grave diſcourſes, he imparteth and recounts his <hi>Voyages</hi> and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, his comforts and diſcomforts unto <hi>her;</hi> yea, he deſcends unto <hi>particulars</hi> of his own health, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and exerciſes in that ugly place whereunto he was baniſhed; and adviſeth <hi>her</hi> in the like manner, what he thinks to be moſt neceſſary for <hi>her.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170557:26"/>[onely] to perſons prudent and abſolute in Vertue; yea, great circumſpection muſt be uſed herein, men uſually fortifying themſelves with much precaution, obſerving diligently the diſpoſition of their <hi>Nature,</hi> the cauſes of Temptations, and the maladies of the <hi>Soul,</hi> whereby the more ſucceſsfully, and with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect, to attain the Cure:</p>
               <p>Love (indeed may be termed the <hi>Phronzy</hi> of the Underſtanding, the Poyſon of the Heart, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of <hi>Manners,</hi> and the deſolation of the life in ſome; yet doth it not follow, that <hi>women</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fat of the ruine of <hi>men:</hi> Many indeed reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoſe <hi>Serpents,</hi> which requite them with poyſon who ſing pleaſant ſongs unto them: But what? ſhall we bring an accuſation againſt Nature in general, and conclude nothing to be good of all that God made, becauſe it may be corrupted by the wickedneſs of men?

               <p>Onely let it be our greateſt care, not to ſerve two <hi>Miſtiſſes</hi> [<hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Beauties</hi> of the World] which are ſo different, as not to agree: When <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Sampſon</hi> endeavoured to accord them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Laſcivious, inſtead of being <hi>Holy;</hi> The <hi>one</hi> at firſt, could overthrow a <hi>Giant;</hi> but had no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the wound from <hi>Bathſheba</hi>'s eye, but <hi>Love</hi> ſoon dryed up all his <hi>Victories;</hi> and thoſe eyes which firſt diſcovered <hi>her</hi> at the <hi>Fountains</hi> head, had much ado to cure themſelves with the <hi>waters</hi> of many <hi>tears:</hi> And when the other betook himſelf to the

                  <hi>Comb</hi> and <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> being former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like a ſhining <hi>Sun,</hi> enlightning his <hi>Nation,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a coal and dark <hi>vapour,</hi> having no longer eyes, but to deplore the fondneſs and diſafter of his love, with <hi>Tears</hi> of blood.</p>
               <p>As the beſt <hi>Wine</hi> is moſt ſubject to degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Vineger;</hi> ſo we ſee the chaſteſt <hi>Love</hi> (if heed be not taken) changeth it ſelf into <hi>Fleſh.</hi> How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then ſhould we avoid &amp; reject the firſt thoughts of ſuch miſerable <hi>Deſigns</hi> (as being the firſt ſparkles of this <hi>fire</hi>) leſt by giving too great a command to our <hi>Paſſion,</hi> we give too great an overture to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs.</p>
               <p>We finde, what the <hi>World</hi> could not do to <hi>Solomon</hi> (the wiſeſt of men) a <hi>Woman</hi> did; and what the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> could not by himſelf do to <hi>Adam,</hi> he did it by a <hi>Woman:</hi> Neither was it the <hi>Devil,</hi> but the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, which tempted the Sons of God,</hi> Gen. 6.2, So did <hi>Dinah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Shechem; Dalilah, Sampſon; Bathſheba, David;</hi> and millions more have done the like; whoſe eyes being like burning <hi>Lamps,</hi> or <hi>coals</hi> of fire, to kindle their breath, their lips, as lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs to enſnare; and their hands, like <hi>Manacles</hi> or Bands, to binde and hold faſt. How ought we then to make <hi>Jobs covenant with our eyes, not to look upon a Maid?</hi>

               <p>And oh, Happy are thoſe who are ſo inſtructed in the Vertue of <hi>Purity,</hi> as that they know not the leaſt ſhaddow of thoſe ſins which are committed in the world! It being a Fate ſadly attending thoſe, who ſee and ſmell out ſo many vain Cuſtoms, and entertainments of Countries, ſince too ſoon they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170557:27"/>learn, what too late they will forget; taking ſo much fire in at the Ears and Eyes, that water enough will not be found to extinguiſh it; except (with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>) we ſit under the feet of Jeſus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew them with the chryſtal Tears of our Repentance:</p>

                  </gap>l Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers! How didſt thou make profit of Sin, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all? How didſt thou ſanctifie that Love, which ſo little knew the way to any ſanctity? (a work only wrought in thee by the right hand of the Higheſt) Thou which wert a ſinner, wounded with Love, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thy ſelf by Love. Thou changeſt the fire of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> into that of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> thou pluckeſt out the venomous Dart of worldly Love off thy Wound, to make way for the Arrows of Jeſus to pierce thy heart; and that ſoul which was before black, and burnt up with the fire of Concupiſcence, provideth a Fountain for the King of Heaven, and draweth Tears from its ſins, to procure a Pardon.</p>
               <p>And for ever bleſſed are thoſe, who (with this Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of holy Sorrow) conſidering the evil conſequence of ſenſuality, effeminacy, and the too eager purſuit of carnal pleaſure, uſe ſeverity, denyal, and the fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their appetite, when it any way grows unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For why ſhould we thus offer violence to our ſelves? Why ſhould we thus endanger our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate? Shall we drown thoſe Senſes here in a world of pleaſure, which will not hereafter be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure one bottle of Water to refreſh us? O horrour! What? Of the Members of Jeſus Chriſt, to make them the members of an unclean Creature! O great indignity! What? To worſhip and ſerve our Luſts?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170557:28"/>to adore our ſinful Appetites? O that we would put our ſelves any where into the hands of Innocency, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then among the imaginary felicities of ſin and wickedneſs!</p>
               <p>Say to thy ſelf (O my Soul!) it will not be long until thy Eyes be ſhut, and thy body become trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to all that come near it, unleſs ſpeedily yeilded up to the Earth: And no ſooner will death abſent thee from the eyes of thy Friends, but forgetfulneſs will draw thee off from their heart: Thou art enforced, O my Soul! to inhabite in a ſickly body, encountring with all ſorts of pains and maladies: O my God! What a favour then is it to be baniſhed from ſo many Gouts, Sciaticks, Collicks, ſo many pains of Head, Teeth, and Heart; ſo much hunger, thirſt, and other infirmities which afflict a frail and momentary body.</p>
               <p>And oh that we would but remember this when Temptation comes upon us! When we are tempted to give up our minde to the world, and drown our ſelves in earthly cares; when we are tempted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, pleaſures, and evil company, with the neglect of the Duties of Gods Worſhip! That we would but ſeriouſly be-think, whether the world will then be as ſweet as now? Whether our unruly Paſſions and Luſts will then bear the ſame ſway with us? and whether all the Glories, Beauty, Honours, and Preferments of the world, will not then ſeem needleſs, vain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable?</p>
               <p>Alas! Will any of thoſe things be comfortable to thee at that day of Reckoning? Is this a day to be forgotten? Is not that man worſe then mad, that is going to judgement, and never thinks of it? Should

               </p>
               <p>TO mention the ſad effects of ſenſual Love, which hath ſo many ways of working, will be a Task very hard and difficult, ſeeing this <hi>Fury</hi> hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hands, and a thouſand attractives; yea, for the moſt part different, and quite oppoſite: It takes by the eyes, by the ears, by the Imagination, by change of purpoſe, by flying, purſuing, honouring, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting by complacency, and by diſdain.</p>
               <p>Somtimes it lays hold by Tears, by laughing, by modeſty, by boldneſs, by confidence, by ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by ſimplicity, by ſpeech, and by ſilence.

Briefly, if we behold one transfixed with violent Love, we ſhall finde, he hath all that in his love, which Divines have placed in Hell; <hi>viz.</hi> Darkneſs, flames, an evil Conſcience, an ill ſavour, and baniſhment from the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>Sin will not at firſt diſcover its dreadful events, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170557:29"/>Tragedies; It will perchance ſhew you a chamber wherein Beauty is preſented, which hideth groſs infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: It preſents you with ſmiles, glances, Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and flatteries, which yet carry nothing with them but ruine; yea, it ſhews you Sports and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Tears, and Funerals in one day.</p>
               <p>Alas! How many millions of men are there in the world, who would be moſt fortunate and flouriſhing, if they knew how to avoid the miſchievous power of this Paſſion? Hence is it that ſo many Virgins are ſtoln away, ſo many Families deſolated, and Parents precipitated [often times] into their Tombs, by their ungrateful children: That ſo many little Innocents are made away by death, whoſe birth alſo is often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: Hence is it, that ſo many Widdows are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, that chaſte Wedlocks are diſturbed, and ſo many Rapes committed.</p>
               <p>Is it not hence that ſo many are abandoned to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, their Eſtates to pillage and poverty, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to infamy, and their whole lives to continual diſturbances? Is it not hence that poyſons are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, that Halters are noozed, that Swords are ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thoſe Tragedies begun in the Night, are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the Scaffold in full day-light?</p>
               <p>Good God! What heavie ſcourges do always fall on ſin? and what a pleaſing ſpectacle (among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confuſions) is it to ſee any Victory gained over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Love? It were eaſie to enlarge the Hiſtory of Loves power, which would require a Volumn greater then hath yet been ſeen, if I ſhould tell you, how Love oftentimes rejecteth the greateſt commands, wiſeſt Edicts, and beſt Laws: How it deſpiſeth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

               <p>It is compared alſo by ſome to Fire (the moſt active and ſtrongeſt worker of all the Elements) which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth Caſtles, Houſes, and Cities, which melts and conſumes the hardeſt Metals; and if our contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dive into former Times, or if we turn over the variety, as well of Modern as Ancient Hiſtories [not only Divine but Humane] we ſhall finde the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our evil Love; how Ambition, Revenge, and Murther [vices which not only eclipſe our judgments, but darken our underſtandings] have ever proved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Undertakers thereof, and that we ſhall not only ſee with grief, but finde with repentance, how this Paſſion of fond Love hath brought ſhame inſtead of glory, miſery for felicity, and affliction for content, where affection hath not had reaſon for its guide, nor vertue for its object.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpare to inſiſt on thoſe infamous Ladies, whoſe memory (purchaſed by odious Luſt) will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the courſe of time; as <hi>Cleopatra, Fauſtina, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſtra,</hi> with the laſt whereof, <hi>Aegiſtus</hi> loſt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, through too great a familiarity; and we finde not a few to ſuffer a great eclipſe of their credit, through their too much effeminacy; whence it was, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> being demanded a great price for a little pleaſure, by the Courtezan <hi>Lais,</hi> anſwered, <hi>I will not buy repentance at ſo dear a rate:</hi> well, conſidering that the faireſt flowers do as well ſerve for a ſhelter to hide Aſpes and Serpents, as to beautifie Garlands and Chaplets; neither would deſire the fruit of that Tree, nor the kernel of that Apple, which was at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170557:30"/>firſt of that fatal and dreadful conſequence to the Taſter.</p>
               <p>The things we finde commended in <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> by our bleſſed Saviour, was her humility, and the Office ſhe performed to his feet, and no way admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her comly countenance, and the pleaſant flower of her youth, which ſhe had too often made as a ſnare to betrey her Lovers; and all to let us ſee how loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, diſreliſhing, and unſavoury are the husks of vain and empty Beauty; and how irkſome the taſte of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures are, (which like deep laughing, ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a deep ſigh in the end) in reſpect of thoſe inward vertues of the ſoul, to be preferred beyond the fair and ruddy fruit of Earthly Beauty.</p>
               <p>But then again on the contrary, how large do we finde Hiſtory in ſetting forth the admirable command which ſome have had over themſelves, who would not make Beauty their Object, nor be ſurprized with amorous folly. <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not be tempted by his Miſtris. Holy <hi>Job, Made a Covenant with his eyes, not to look upon a Maid;</hi> with many other the like Examples we read of in the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Do we not read of the Roman <hi>Stilpo,</hi> who notwithſtanding he were naturally addicted to Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, became abſolute Commander of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by reading only certain Precepts of Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy? What admirable Continency alſo do we finde mentioned of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in ſparing the Wife of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and his three Daughters? <hi>Scipio</hi> (after many years proſperous exploits) purchaſed not more glory, then by overcoming himſelf, when a beautiful maid was brought unto him, whom he returned (with a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170557:30"/>great reward) unto him to whom ſhe was eſpouſed.</p>
               <p>No leſs worthy to be noted (not to mention thoſe Noble Matrons, whoſe Vertue and Chaſtity will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the Period of all Ages; as <hi>Porcia, Octavia, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia, Cornelia,</hi> &amp;c.) were <hi>Marius, Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, and many others, recorded for their Princely command over themſelves and their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
               <p>If Beauty then chance to ſhew thee a fair Viſage, remember the Syrens do the ſame; if ſhe allure thee by her Careſſes, ſo doth the Panther; if her amorous plaints invite thee, let the ſighs of the Crocodile be thy Inſtruction: Her greateſt brightneſs is (at beſt) but a falſe and fading Meteor: And ſeldome (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) doth Beauty and Honeſty dwell together.</p>
               <p>Thou then that art beautified with an Angelical Feature, Why ſhouldeſt thou participate of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creature? Why wilt thou ſuffer ſo great an Eclipſe for a minutes pleaſure, ſince this Vice above all others, derogates ſo much from thy Honour.</p>
               <p>It was ill Phyſick, and only fit for ſo luxurious a a Phyſician, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> uſed to one of his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>viz.</hi> To lay him on a Down bed, in a perfumed chamber, crowning him with a Garland of ſweet ſmelling Flowers, and (after a Potion or two of good Drink) to bring him a beautiful young Wench, which could play, ſing, and dance. And was it not as great a vanity which <hi>Cteſias</hi> relates of a Perſian King, that had an hundred and fifty Maids attending his Table, to play, ſing, and dance by turns. The like whereof another reports of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prince, who ſtill kept nine Virgins of moſt excellent Feature, and ſweet Voices, to wait on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:170557:31"/>But were theſe things well conſidered by thoſe who are ſurprized with an amorous folly, their deſires would not be ſo much bent to ſenſuality, nor their delights wholly engaged to fleſhly Liberty: Beauty would not ſo often be their Object, nor Vanity the ſubject of their diſcourſe; they would not be ſo often fieng'd in the flames of that Love, which cannot hold without jealouſie, nor break without repentance. Neither would Complexion take up ſo much room in their thoughts, who ſhould rather give themſelves to Diviner Meditations.</p>

               <p>Hence was it, that one wittily compared the heart of a <hi>Lover</hi> to a <hi>Stage,</hi> whereon (at the ſame time) were ſeen Sports and <hi>Banquets,</hi> Battels and <hi>Funerals;</hi> yea, this delicate admired <hi>Enchantreſs,</hi> will prove but a very ſad <hi>bargain,</hi> even to thoſe that enjoy <hi>her</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own <hi>luſts,</hi> and at their own rate, <hi>ſhe</hi> being no better then a <hi>Canker-roſe</hi> full of deception and ſorrow.</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Affections</hi> and ſervices can no longer be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world, when we are thus engaged to falſe <hi>Divinities.</hi> Poor Creatures then as we are! to love rather to meaſure the world in its <hi>vanity,</hi> then to poſſeſs it in the love of God! To prefer darkneſs, before the <hi>Sun;</hi> Thorns, before Grapes; Acorns, before good Corn, and not to place our affections on our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was crucified for us!

               </p>
               <p>You then that have no other <hi>Idol,</hi> but <hi>Beauty;</hi> who worſhip no other <hi>Deities,</hi> but pleaſure and <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> O conſider, that as a <hi>Roſe</hi> adorned with its own leaves, obſcures the <hi>Beauty</hi> of all other <hi>Flowers;</hi> ſo the beſt Art, is to have no Art; to take whatever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given, and to render all to <hi>God:</hi> Let not your thoughts ſtrike ſail to <hi>Affection,</hi> let not your hearts do homage to that <hi>Beauty,</hi> which will enſnare and impriſon you in the Fetters of ſin; but rather timely reſiſt the influence of your <hi>amorous</hi> aſſaults, being the <hi>Rocks</hi> whereon many have ſadly ſuffered <hi>ſhipwrack,</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> which ſends forth many poyſoned <hi>ſtreams;</hi> and the <hi>Tree,</hi> whoſe fruit is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ſtomach, how pleaſing ſoever it be to the palate.</p>
               <p>Conſider further, how that in an inſtant God can

The <hi>ſin</hi> of the body, too often begins in that of the <hi>face,</hi> which is inſenſibly eaten with painting and poyſon, and too often do we derive <hi>Beauty</hi> from corruption.</p>
               <p>Neither do I know a better way to ſtop the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Luſt, then to think of the end thereof. Thoſe that in the firſt Temptation will but take the pains to draw the Curtain, ſhall behold ſuch a huge Gulph of ſcandals, injuries, rages, lothſomneſs, and deſpairs, as that they would as willingly almoſt deſcend into hell alive, as conſent to this brutiſh Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Who would not account him mad, who always walks in ſolitude; who courts a ſhaddow, who ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, laugheth, feareth, waxeth pale, bluſheth, deſireth, hateth, dieth, riſeth again, is now in earth, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in heaven, in one hour acteth a Comedy of a dozen Perſonages, and every minute changeth and metamorphoſeth himſelf? What a ſilly thing is it to ſee any one thus to trouble and vex himſelf in purſuit of a wylie Wench, that delights to exerciſe Her moſt infamous Tyrannie?</p>
               <p>Is it not a pitiful thing to ſee a man burn in Ice, and congeal in Fire? Having the colour wan, the Viſage meagre, the eyes hollow, the cheeks ſunk, the ſpirits giddy, the reaſon uncollected, and the whole Body Feveriſh and diſtemper'd, for a creature that will ſoon fail his expectation? Who is there that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that King, who ſuffered his Minion to take off
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170557:34"/>his Crown, and ſet her Slippers on his head? That <hi>Dionyſius</hi> (the Tyrant) ſhould write the expeditions of his Kingdom, and that <hi>Mirrha</hi> (his Wife) ſhould Cancel, or Signe them at her pleaſure? Who would not be aſtoniſhed at the Roman <hi>Macarius,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conquered Love in the world, was ſurprized in the Wilderneſs, by finding a Womans Shooe? And yet may we daylie obſerve an infinite number of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters much more ſtrange.</p>
               <p>Why go we then about to Idolize a Woman? Have we not ſlavery enough at home, but we muſt needs ſeek it abroad? O let us conſider, that they which thus ſuffer their heads to run at liberty after ſuch ſottiſh Loves, die a thouſand times a day in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of ſcornful Beauty; and have little cauſe to brag, yea, though they attain the end of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; their Paſſions being moſt violent for things that muſt quickly be taken from them.</p>
               <p>What a ſhame is it to obſerve many, who waſte ſo much of their precious time for the kiſs of a Hand, the touch of a Lip, the glance of an Eye, the untying of a Shooe-ſtring, and the like? That they ſhould thus make a <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of a piece of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and kiſs the Fetters of their ſlavery, inſtead of breaking them! That they ſhould take a glory to ſacrifice their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to that Idol, whereby at laſt they ſuffer a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervitude!</p>
               <p>And as for the cruelties attending this Paſſion; What Furies, what Poyſons, what Racks, what Swords, and Gibbets belong to the violence of enraged <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?</hi> And ſhall we ſtill rejoyce in the ſenſe-pleaſing flatteries of our ſenſual <hi>Deſires?</hi> What? Nothing to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170557:34"/>be ſeen but Tears, Horrour, Grief, Aſtoniſhment, and other repreſentations of death? And ſhall we thus Court thoſe flames? Shall we embrace that Stake to which we ſhall be a <hi>Martyr?</hi> Ah! Were we but well awaked, with what horrour ſhould we behold the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices</hi> whereinto we are falling? How plain ſhould we behold theſe golden <hi>ſnares,</hi> which (like the Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of <hi>Medea,</hi> or the <hi>Trojan Horſe</hi>) will at laſt bear <hi>Arms</hi> againſt us?</p>
               <p>And to the end then, that we may not turmoil and weary our ſelves in the <hi>By-paths</hi> which directly lead us into the myre of violent <hi>affection,</hi> neither wholly reſign our ſelves over to ſuch a groſs indiſcretion, I ſhall ſhew you the <hi>Medeas</hi> we often Court, under the Story of <hi>One,</hi> who had almoſt loſt his Wits, as well as Reputation, through the violent purſuit of a Lady he much adored, who finding no other ſlight or ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem to vanquiſh the importunate extravagancies of this paſſionate <hi>Lover,</hi> ſhewed him her Neck, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her <hi>Boſome,</hi> all gnawn and eaten with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne <hi>Cancer; Behold, fond Lover</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>what thou ſo eagerly Courteſt!</hi> and ſo inſtantly made the <hi>Cancer</hi> of her body, to cure the <hi>Cancer</hi> of his minde: <hi>vitae Patrum Occid. l.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſhame to entertain ſuch worldly <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and petty <hi>Loves,</hi> only to pleaſe fleſh and blood, and which are no ſooner diſliked by the Eye, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſted by the heart? We read of ſome, who have fought with it on Thorns, Hair-clothes, and other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities; and we finde mention of One, who being bound to a Bed of Roſes with ſilken Cords, to reſigne himſelf to the love of a Courtezan, ſpit out his <hi>Tongue</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:170557:35"/>in her <hi>Face.</hi> Some have alſo aſſwaged their Paſſion by <hi>flames;</hi> Others have quenched the heat of their deſires in ſnows; Others, by living in rocks, and ſolitary wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes; as if nothing were ſo invincible, and hardly attain'd, as this Vertue of <hi>Chaſtity;</hi> Nothing ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as to ſee all the follies of entranced Lovers.</p>
               <p>But the chiefeſt way amongſt many humane Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, which tend to the curing of Love [it being to no end to hold long Diſcourſes, and to appoint many Meditations to a ſharp Fever, which is full of ravings, and furious ſymptomes] is to owe all our health this way to <hi>the fear of God,</hi> to Prayer, Faſting, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which is far better then all other inventions.</p>
               <p>Make uſe alſo often of the memory of death. Set an aſſiduous watch over thy eyes, ears, heart, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Avoid anger, ſince anger and love work upon one ſubject. Abſent your ſelf from that Preſence which is the nouriſhment of your Flames. Thoſe Comets which are ſaid to be fed by the vapours of the Earth, are no longer maintained, then nouriſhment is afforded; and that Love, which burns and ſhines like a falſe Star in our heart, will ſoon go out, if you refuſe ſuſtenance from the face you admire, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which entertains you in an enchanted Palace, full of chains and charms.</p>
               <p>Withdraw your ſelf then betime from this capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; gain the Haven, before the ſtorm ſurprize you; for if you be once engaged, there is neither Arm nor Oar can bring you ſafe. Let us enter ſeriouſly into our ſelves, and daylie conſider what paſſeth there, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off this Paſſion which raiſeth ſuch a Storm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. Let us ever keep a vigilant Guard, leſt Satan

               <p>HE that loves the World, and the Glories thereof, entertains a thouſand buſineſſes, and every buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath a world of employments, and thoſe ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by variety of circumſtances, as that it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to underſtand them, and much more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with them: whereas ſweet are the ſleeps of thoſe, who prefer heaven before earth, and Chaſtity and Temperance, before the wantonneſs and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a debauched converſation.</p>
               <p>Why (alas!) then ſhould we ruine our certainties in the fruitleſs expectation of vanity and ſhaddows? What ſlender footing will theſe acceſſory commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have, when death, deformity, poverty, contempt, and ſickneſs are at our heels? Let us timely conſider then, how many boxes full of Pills the faireſt Beauties have at home in their Cheſts, to take when the Rheum and other infirmities aſſail them: Since God gives us leave to diſpoſe of our diſlodging from theſe fading Tabernacles, ſhall we not prepare our ſelves unto it? O let us ſeaſonably bid farewel to our company, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170557:36"/>let us ſhake off thoſe violent Hold-faſts, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange us from our future happineſs.</p>
               <p>As thoſe eyes ſeldom burn with Luſt, which are bedewed with Tears; ſo thoſe who prefer the light of God's preſence before all corporal Beauty, do eaſily perceive how little it is to be regarded. They will not exchange the glorious Sun, for the light of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Here they can have no Lightning without the Thunder, that makes it ſeems more dreadful then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; and therefore will prefer a ſilent night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a tempeſtuous day; and the everlaſting views of the face of God, before the falſe Lights of the world.</p>
               <p>The light of the Sun (indeed) lighteth all the world, but how uſeleſs will it be, when Jeſus [who is the true light of the world] ſhall appear in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heaven. The Roſe looks fair (indeed) but is not the Beauty faded, and the ſweetneſs expired, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, before the ſcars in gathering of it be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The honey ſeems pleaſant to the taſte, but alas! Who would have it with ſo many ſmarting ſtings?</p>
               <p>Thou (then) that art taken with a pleaſing ſmile; thou whom a ſigh, a glance, or tears beguil; oh, turn thine eyes aſide! Forbear to Sayl in ſo dangerous a Tyde, leſt Syrens aſſail, or ſhipwrack attend thee; few attaining their deſired harbour with ſuch a wind of vanity; all thy labour and rowing in ſo leaking and weather-beaten a Veſſel, will prove at laſt but as a handful of waters to a man that is drowning, which will help rather to deſtroy then ſave him.</p>
               <p>Alas! What is the Beauty that thou ſo admireſt? When the night comes, it is nothing to thee; and while thou haſt gazed on it, Hath it not withered
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170557:36"/>away? Canſt thou not even ſhut thy eyes, and fancy all into darkneſs or deformity? Or will not a few leprous ſpots, or malignant ulcers, ſoon divert thy affections, and make the Idol of thy Love to become the ſad ſpectacle of thy diſtaſte? Suppoſe that thou ſaw'ſt that beautiful Carcaſs lying on a Bier, carrying to be buried, or rotting in a grave, the skul digged up, and the bones ſcattered, where will be thy lovely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Canſt thou then love a skin full of dirt?</p>
               <p>Or didſt thou but behold thy beautiful <hi>Dalilah,</hi> thy lovely Miſtris, on a dying Bed, panting, ſchrieching, groaning, turning from one ſide to another, and pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for breath, her eyes gaſtfully rolling, her lips fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, her hands trembling, her mouth diſtorted through violent Convulſions, thoſe White and Reds (ſo much admired) turn'd into a black ſwarthineſs, and her whole body declining into clay; Ah tell me now what thou thinkeſt! Canſt thou now ſweetly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, or take any pleaſure in it? O my Soul then! Withdraw thy thoughts from the fading Beauties of the world: Let not the ſhaddow, but the Sun direct thee: Labour to fix thy eyes upon the only true and lovely object of thy eternal happineſs.</p>

               <head>That when all <hi>Loves</hi> fail, the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> remains.</head>
               <p>THe Soul of man is unſatisfied, nothing but the Creator thereof will content it: It walks but ſadly amongſt the Riches, Honours, and Dignities of the world; all the joys, glories, and beatitudes of the earth, afford it no comfort. It wholly repreſents God as the beginning and end of all things, and is raviſhed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170557:37"/>with its glory, as poor creatures uſe to be with the heat of the Sun. It is he alone which the ſoul ſeeks, eſteems, and honours: All that ſhe ſees, hears, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands beſides, is nothing to her, if it carry not his Name, and take colour from his Beauty; ſhe well knows ſhe ſhall get all by loving him, and death it ſelf, which comes from his Love, is the gate of Life.</p>
               <p>Here, we every night finde a little death in our ſleep: ſickneſs and pains are ſtill ſubject to overtake us, neither indeed do we know what belongs to a Crown, Scepter, or Kingdom while we are in this baſe life: But ſurely, had we talked [only] one quarter of an hour with a bleſſed Soul departed, and diſcourſed of the State of the other life, Oh! How would our heart diſſolve into deſires? How would we haſten to go out of that ruinous houſe, where of we are but Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants? How would we be raviſhed to hear theſe words, Go faithful ſoul, out of this Body, go out with joy, in full peace and ſafety; the eternal mountains [thoſe glorious Heavens] and all the goodly company of Angels, and bleſſed Spirits, which there inhabite, will there receive thee? Go on confidently, behold God is ready to wipe away all thy Tears; No more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, no more clamours; behold an Eſtate altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new? Oh, What Repoſe! What Peace! What ceſſation of Troubles ſhall we there meet with!</p>
               <p>Our Saviour met the Young-man that was carried to Burial, at the Gate of <hi>Naim,</hi> Luke 7.11. [which is interpreted, The Town of <hi>Beauties</hi>] to ſhew us, that neither Beauty, nor Youth, are freed from the Laws of Death. And it was not impertinately ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed of a young man, who going eagerly after the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170557:37"/>purſuit of his Luſts, met a dead Corps in his way, which occaſion'd his return, and the future amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that, and other his exorbitant and laſcivious courſes.</p>
               <p>And truly, as the conſideration of our aſhes will humble us under the greateſt Pride, ſo will it abate and conſume our burning Luſt; he being very ſtrong by Nature, or wicked by his own choice, who will not amend himſelf, having aſhes for his Glaſs, and death for his Miſtris.</p>
               <p>Oh! What then is it (ſilly duſt and aſhes!) that thus ſtrangely enflames thy ſwelling veins, when the leaſt breath, or ſhew of death, is like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s hand-writing on the Wall, ever ready to affright thee? Wilt thou then purſue thoſe ſeeming joys and fancies which will at laſt vaniſh into a dejected Melancholy? Wilt thou unadviſedly let looſe the Reins of thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, towards the enjoyment of ſuch periſhing Pleaſures? If ſo, oh! How dearly wilt thou buy thy folly!</p>
               <p>What are we alas! and what is all we call ours? To day we flouriſh, and are well ſpoken of; we pleaſe, and are in favour with men. But (out alas!) our flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will fade to morrow, and we ſhall be evil ſpoken of, and out of favour with God and man.</p>
               <p>And whither tends all this (O my ſoul!) but to tell thee, that thou art made to wait on thy Lord, and Spouſe, and wholly to thirſt after Divine things; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt thou ever think to attain perfect reſt and happineſs in the troubleſome Bed of this world. Three cubits of earth will ſuffice us, and how little or much ſoever we poſſeſs, how beautiful or deformed ſoever
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170557:38"/>we are, this is all ſhall be left us. Yet, how often (O God!) doth it come to paſs, that for a little deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Beauty, a little fugitive honour, a little filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure [and that not long] we ſo ſlightly regard the joys of heaven, neither dread the everlaſting pains of hell.</p>
               <p>He that but truly be-thinks himſelf of <hi>Haman</hi>'s pride, of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s ſacriledge, <hi>Ahab</hi>'s covetouſneſs, <hi>Abſolon</hi>'s hair, <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s locks, and <hi>Dives</hi> riches, ſhall quickly finde, that theſe things wherein we moſt preſum'd, and which we eſteem'd our beſt ſupport, may ſuddenly become the occaſion of our ruine and deſtruction. You then that ſay, Come, and let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſures that are; let us take our fill of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wine, and ſweet perfumes, and no way loſe the flower of our time; let us crown our ſelves with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, before they fade away, and let no meadow be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſed by us; O that ye would but a little appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that what this way ſeems moſt to afford you content, expoſeth you a hundred times a day to the hazard of your lives.</p>
               <p>For how little alas! is the continuance [at beſt] of all the favours of Fortune? When one Sun-ſhine of pleaſure is paſt, in comes a Tempeſt; and when one ſtorm is diſperſed, how are we again caſt into new deſpairs; and [at laſt] with what dreadful complaints (able to rend Rocks and Marbles aſunder) will we lament our ſins, then preſented unto us, like ſo many Furies, which heretofore we eſteemed ſo light.</p>
               <p>If then at any time thou art taken with the Syren and pleaſing ſmiles of the world; if thou ſeem here to content thy ſelf in the beholding of earthly Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rich furniture, exquiſite pictures, and ſweet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170557:38"/>if thou ſeem here to pleaſe thy melancholy Fancy, in high Mountains, goodly Forreſts, rich Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, fair Meadows, pleaſant Rivers, and beautiful Flowers; O do but be-think thy ſelf! What are theſe? What is this to Heaven? What is this to Eternity? All being but a little Atome to the unſpeakable joys of the Celeſtial Paradice.</p>
               <p>Earthly delights may (I confeſs) aſtoniſh, but can never ſatiate our ſenſes. Temporal Beauty is but a tranſitory charm, an illuſion of our ſenſes, a Flower which hath but a moment of life, and a Dyal, which we never look on, but when the Sun ſhines: What is humane glory, but a Dunghil covered with ſnow, a Glaſs painted with falſe colours, a ſugar'd Fruit gilded with poyſon, or a dangerous Hoſteſs in a fair Houſe? Shall we then truſt ſo fading a good? Shall we hazard our Souls in ſo unhappy a ſnare? Or, ſhall we tye out contentments to ſo ſlippery a knot? Or dote upon temporal goods, which like chirping Birds, give us only a little Muſick in the Summer, and ſo fly away?</p>
               <p>There are ſome, who upon theſe words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>By the waters of Babylon we ſate down and wept,</hi> have compared the temporal goods and delights of the world to theſe Waters; not only for their ſwift running away, and never returning; but for their trouble in procuring, and their ſorrow in loſing; and well may we therefore <hi>hang up our Harps,</hi> and ſit down <hi>weeping,</hi> while we live in this <hi>Babylon</hi> of Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, Wiſdom tells us, that ſuch is the vanity of all earthly goods, as that there is nothing ſo great in this Vale of Tears, whoſe loſs ſhould any way
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170557:39"/>diſquiet us. VVhat are our bodies but the food of worms? Our gaudy Attires, but nouriſhment for Moths? Our ſtately pyled Houſes, but ſtones and morter? Our moſt precious Jewels, but the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an enraged Sea [which borrow their worth from our weak fancy] and all our honours, but the golden Masks and Weather-cocks of inconſtancy?</p>
               <p>O unfortunate Worldling! Where then are thy thoughts fixed? What is here in the world that can deſerve thy love? Behold the whole Fabrick of the Creation, and ſee what thou canſt meet with worth thy affection? Canſt thou then embarque thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch trecherous Syrens? Seeſt thou not that thy riches, friends, reputation, companions, and all will at laſt forſake thee, as a Butterfly, which eſcapes the hand of a childe? Whereat then aims thy ſtrong Ambition? What means thy burning Avarice, Thy profuſe Ryot? What will one day become of thy wretched profit, thy fading pleaſures? Will not all vaniſh into fancy, and a body of ſmoak; and nothing avail thee, when thy mouth ſhall be ſtopt with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſilence?</p>
               <p>Be not then ſo bad a Merchant, as to ſell things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal for temporal. It is for ſilly flies to gad only in the Sun-ſhine of this world: This Enchantreſs, which thou ſo much admireſt, and enjoyeſt after thy own luſts, will at laſt prove but a very bad bargain, full of vanity, deception, and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Ah! That thou ſhouldeſt love poyſon, and embrace death! That we ſhould ſeek our own ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion! Doth the world tempt thee to honour? Oh deſpiſe it in humility: If to Riches, O ſcorn it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170557:39"/>And O my Soul! Let not the wings of thy love to God, be entangled with the bird-lime of temporal things! God hath eſpouſed thee a chaſte Virgin to himſelf; Let not thoſe Love-tokens which he hath ſent to engage thy Affections, more ſtrongly to himſelf, ſeduce thy heart from him, who except he may have the choiceſt, will admit of none of thy love.</p>

               <p>ALl the happineſs and felicity of man in this world, is a Dream; it comes on we know not how, and when it vaniſheth, we cannot ſo much as diſcern whether it is gone: Yea, How do all the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions thereof paſs away in an unperceived motion. When we ſuppoſe them faſt lock'd in our arms, they creep from us in a miſt or ſmoak, which ſilently ſteals out at the chimnies top, after it hath fouled and ſmut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it within.</p>
               <p>Our life is but like the neſt of ſome ſilly Bird, whoſe beſt compoſure and materials are ſtraw and duſt; and as ſoon doth the ſtately Palaces and Courts of the greateſt Princes decay, as the poor reſting place of a Swallow comes dropping down at the approach of Winter. What (alas!) ſhall I ſay? ſince whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we reflect our eyes, we ſhall finde cauſe ſufficient to diſſolve them into Tears. If we look up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while we behold our Country aloof, we cannot but conſider our ſelves in baniſhment: If on earth, it is but the upbraiding remembrance of our grave; and how proudly ſoever we trample it under our feet
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170557:40"/>at preſent, it makes full account to have the diſpoſure of our heads; yea, the greateſt Emperours after death, are found ſitting in Vaults under earth in ſilence, and mournful Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any thing (when all other Beauty, Honours, and happineſs proves brittle and inconſtant) which remains to yeild us comfort, but the benefit we receive from the few hours we ſpend in Prayer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and the Exerciſes of a pious life. Now, now is the time, that in one little part of an hour, we may obtain pardon here, which all Eternity ſhall not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Now is the time, that in one ſhort day we may have more debts ſo given us, then in all the years and times to come.</p>
               <p>Here may we ſo lament for ſins committed, as to eſcape everlaſting puniſhment: Here's nothing but the fearful cracks of ruines every where, the dreadful roaring of ſtorms and tempeſts on every ſide. Our houſe ſtill threatens its fall, and we are (with S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>) in the midſt of a violent ſhower of ſtones on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hand, and ſhall we not think of retyring our ſelves to our heavenly Countrey? Shall we not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly then leave the houſe of our Pilgrimage here, for thoſe glorious Manſions above! O happy Countrey! O bleſſed Manſions, which are provided for us in our Fathers houſe!</p>
               <p>But O Eternity, Eternity! How little do we think on thee? Or ſtrive to avoid thoſe endleſs miſeries, and thoſe perpetual nights of horrour and ſadneſs, which cuſtome in ſinning will aſſuredly bring upon us? Alas!

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170557:40"/>and procure eternal wretchedneſs? Alas! How do all the ſweet waters of our pleaſures, at laſt run ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily into a Sea of ſorrows and bitterneſs? How doth ſadneſs dive into the bottom of the Soul, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights tickle us in the outſide of the skin? How like a bunch of Grapes (ſaith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) are the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings joys, whoſe juyce is preſſed out? How full of diſquietneſs are they? Their fulneſs (at beſt) being ſeaſoned with ſhame and repentance. Oh! How do they (like abortives) die in the birth; yea, too often prove the executioners of the owners, or leave us, like a poor Pilgrim, diſpoiled by thieves?</p>
               <p>We finde our Saviour diſſwading his Diſciples from Ambition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.20. and to call Riches thorns, as bearing fair flowers, but the fruit very bad; yea, ſerves as a ſhelter for Vipers and ſerpents. Yet, oh inſatiable Avarice! Whither doſt thou tranſport our manners and underſtanding? Ah! the forgetfulneſs of our condition: Alas! What are we? Whence came we? Was it not a few years ſince we were born naked, creeping on the earth, and having a mouth open to cries and hunger; and do we think we have nothing, except we poſſeſs all things?</p>
               <p>Alas!

               <p>Nor is there any other way to take away the ſting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170557:41"/>of death, or make our life comfortable. Our honour will lie in the duſt, and ſleep in a Bed of earth. Our <hi>Riches will not deliver us in the day of wrath:</hi> what if thou leave them behind to procure a few mourning weeds to attend thy Herſe, or erect ſome glorious Monument to thy memory; yet will they at laſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflict then relieve thee at the hour of thy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Oh, but thou wilt ſay, thy friends ſhall help thee: Alas!

Such miſerable comforters are all things thou canſt think on here below.</p>
               <p>When all things leave thee, the love of God, and a good Conſcience will be thy familiar friends, and which muſt ever attend thee: That Balmof Gilead, which muſt chear thee; and that Palm of Peace which muſt at laſt crown thee: And truly, we have daylie need of God, and not of man to help us: One cries out here, Wretch that I am, who will help me out of miſery? Where ſhall I finde Tears enow to ſave me? Another cries out, What ſhall I do? Muſt I needs leave my only Father, my dear Husband, my loving Brother, my ſweet and only Childe? Oh let me die! Some good body or other make an end of me!</p>
               <p>The black clouds of ſorrow ſomtimes ſo ſadly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow us, as that (with <hi>Jacob</hi>) we rend our clothes, and will needs go down with ſorrow to our Grave; We often cry out, What, for ever? <hi>In aeternum vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicere?</hi> What, to part for ever? To forſake the world, and all our friends, what more troubleſome? What? To take this young betrothed, this poor Maid, this
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170557:41"/>intended Husband? What? To lay hold on one ſo well beloved, in the flower of his age, ſo freſh, ſo flouriſhing, ſo full of Honour and Proſperity? O cruel and malicious Death! What? Haſt thou Ears of Braſs and Diamonds, and wilt not hear our cries? Alas! What do I here? I am but a living death, and an unprofitable burden to the earth! Why hadſt thou not rather taken away this Begger, that Cripple, who hath not wherewith to live? Ah Death! Now ſhoot the utmoſt of thy Darts!</p>
               <p>Thus do our humane reſpects too often ſeem to withſtand the Divine Providence. But oh thou that art thus unwilling to part with a Dunghil, an earthly Cottage, to enjoy a life of perpetual Beauty and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity! What (alas!) may we think of thee? That Heaven ſhould open it ſelf to thee, and thou wilt neither embrace it, nor open thy heart to love him that offers it? Alas! O Soul [many times ungrateful and diſloyal] what wilt thou anſwer for ſo great a neglect, when God ſhall call thee to an account? Ah! If we love any thing in the world, let us love it for life eternal! The joys of heaven are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Oh that we might then know our names to be written in the book of Life! Oh how ſhould we finde our Spirits raviſhed with thoſe beautiful Ideas of glory?</p>
               <p>Where can we more fitly commend our ſelves, then unto ſo vaſt a boſom of Compaſſion, as ſhall ſet a period to all the miſeries of this ſinful life? To God (I ſay) who is an endleſs Ocean, and boundleſs Sea of mercy: How can we better fix our thoughts then on our crucified Saviour, and in his countenance, to

It will be no more to him to die, then is one nights ſweet repoſe on a bed of Roſes.</p>
               <p>Who can but behold the ſpirit of Jeſus amongſt thoſe great Convulſions of the world, moving round about the Croſs, in the midſt of thoſe bloody dolours, inſolent cries, and inſupportable blaſphemies? O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſee him there, as in a Sanctuary, bleeding, weeping, and praying, yea mingling his prayers with his tears and blood, and at laſt, to die unmoveably up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of his patience.</p>
               <p>Oh madneſs of men! That ſpend all their time, encreaſe their account, and loſe ſo many fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities [when they might have gotten heaven for a tear, a ſigh, or a groan from a penitent heart] for the attaining of that, which not only proves their eternal ruine hereafter, but occaſions their miſerable vexation here. O worldlings! Thus to deceive your ſelves! Who ſhall weep over you, ſince you know not how to lament and bewail your ſelves? Why alas! are you ſo careful and tender of your bodies, yet daylie entangle your poor ſouls in a thouſand vanities, a thouſand Courtſhips, and a thouſand worldly loves, which defile you, and muſt one day be diſcharged at a dear rate.</p>
               <p>Miſerable wretches! How will you then cry out, what have we done? Once had we time to have wrought out our ſalvation [O precious time!] but theſe golden days are paſt: And have we thus miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170557:42"/>undone our ſelves? Come Rocks, and fall upon us! Come ye Furies and tear us, until we moulder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing.</p>
               <p>Sad creatures then as we are, to procraſtinate and put off our Repentance! Since the Sun, which goes ſo many miles in a minute, and the Stars in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, which go many more, make not ſo much ſpeed, as our body haſtens to the Grave. The devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſword, the conſuming fire, the winds from the Wilderneſs, the Diſeaſes of the Body, and all that afflicted holy <hi>Job,</hi> are ſtill at our heels; what daylie reports do we hear? Such a man is ſlain, another is drowned, a third breaks his neck; this man died eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that man playing, another ſleeping; this by accident, that by his own hands; Oh how great an Elephant, and yet how ſmall a Mouſe can deſtroy us; a pin, a comb, a hair (pulled out) hath gangren'd: Nay, our joy, our mirth, and laughter, our ſhame, and bluſhing may ruine us; and in the very flower of our youth, and bloſſome of our age, we may be untimely nipt, and ſent down into the duſt.</p>
               <p>And alas! If God but a little withdraw our breath, vain is the power of art, vain is the Phyſitians skill, vain and fruitleſs are the ſighs and tears of thy friends, yea vain and helpleſs are the wiſhes of all our kinsfolk. Here ſits one weeping, there another lamenting; yet all to no purpoſe: Neither is it Beauty, or the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask skin, that can help us, when we feel the ſlow pace of our panting pulſe: It is not mirth, nor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which can then affect us, when death in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall diſſolve all our honour into darkneſs. The whole world cannot afford us content, when our Soul
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170557:43"/>is expiring from our body. Neither can all her allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring baits, ſmiling blandiſhments, and beautiful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations avail thee, when thy ſpirits ſhall tremble with affrightful pangs, when all thy ſenſes ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and all the faculties of thy ſoul attempt which way ſooneſt to leave thy body.</p>
               <p>O then, that we did but preſent unto our ſelves, the ſad and miſerable condition at preſent, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is to come; How effectual it would be to raiſe up our thoughts from the fading bloſſoms, and periſhing pleaſures of this tranſitory world! How would it comfort us in all conditions whatſoever? How little would we care for the loſſes and croſſes of this world, did we think of a heavenly kingdom?</p>
               <p>We are all [in the time of our abſence from God] but ſtrangers upon earth: <hi>Let us then paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear;</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. and then he needs not care for ill uſage in his pilgrimage here, who knows he is a King at home. But alas! We too often eat husks, when we ſhould feed on Manna: Great riches cannot make our clothes warm, nor our meat more nouriſhing, why then do we tumble in the myres of this world?</p>
               <p>Seek rather (O Chriſtian Soul!) <hi>for that Kingdom whereof there is no end;</hi> that Kingdom which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely glorious, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. and every way bleſſed, the King that ruleth is eternal, and they that live there, never die; Let our hearts and mouths be ever filled with the praiſes of it; Let our thoughts and words ever bend towards it, ſince we have no other way then this to attain any true and laſting glory.</p>
               <p>Let us alſo wholly reſign our ſelves to him that ſent

We have too long lived in the Gardens of <hi>Adonis,</hi> which in the beginning make ſhew of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but at laſt bring forth nothing but Thorns. Let us then fix a nail in the wheel of this furious, and yet inconſtant Chariot, leſt at laſt we expoſe our ſelves to the hazard of a precipitous fall. Can there be a greater victory then to conquer our own tumultuous thoughts, in ſuch a conjuncture of time, when our own ruine lies at ſtake? Can we better uſe our choiceſt skill, then to ſhake off thoſe enchanting embraces, and turn away our earsfrom thoſe betraying ſighs, leſt (like that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Conquerour, who was vanquiſhed by his own ſlave) we become ſtrangely cruel to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Alas! That we did but conſider how fearful will be the caſe of thoſe who have neglected the day of their ſalvation! If it be a troubleſome thing to be tyed to a Bed of Roſes (though but for a little time) with ſilken ſtrings, oh, what may we think of thoſe damned Souls, which muſt dwell in a bed of Flames, as long as there is a God!</p>
               <p>It will be in vain then to cry to the Hills to fall on us, and to the Mountains to cover us; It will be in vain to repent, and wiſh we had not ſlighted the day of our Viſitation, nor ſold it for a little pleaſure: It will be in vain then to cry, Lord, open to us, oh ſpare us, oh pity us, do not caſt us into Eternal Burnings: O what eaſe! What eternal darkneſs! Blinded world! Proſtituted World! Deſperate World! Ah hadſt thou but known, Hadſt thou but known! But alas! Thy unhappineſs hath put a Scarf before thine eyes.</p>
               <p>O poor ſecure Worldlings! What will you then do, when he that will be your Judge, ſhall come in the

Mountains are gone, the Earth and Heavens do paſs away, and how do you wiſh your ſelves might melt away as they do? But ah, wiſhes are now in vain! To what end doſt thou cry Lord, Lord! It is too late [alas!] too late, why then doſt thou look about thee? Whither doſt thou run? Can any ſave thee? Wretches as you are! To what paſs have you brought your ſelves? How happy had you now been if you had believed and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having only time left to bewail and lament your miſerable condition?</p>
               <p>Ah drowſie earthy Creatures! Are you ſtill hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downward, when heaven is before ye? Are you ſleeping, when ſo great a Treaſure is ſet before you? Are ye taken up with your delights and pleaſures? Had ye rather ſit down in dirt and dung, then walk in the Palace of Heaven? Is it better to be there, then above with your Saviour? Alas, deceived Soul! Come away then out of the Wilderneſs of this World, make no excuſes, frame no delays, look not back on thy worldly buſineſs, thy unbridled luſts, thy ſinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which here took up thy thoughts in this howling Deſart, this Valley of Tears.</p>
               <p>Do but conſider how ſoon thou art to depart hence, then wilt thou finde what thou haſt neglected, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing trifles, and ſo much minding thy proviſion in the way, whilſt thou art haſtening ſo faſt to another world, and thy eternal happineſs lies at ſtake. How wilt thou then cry out upon thy rocky heart, thy proud and unbelieving heart, thy Atheiſtical, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and worldly heart, yea thy carnal and ſenſual
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170557:44"/>heart, for here toyling, and ſelling an endleſs glory for worldly vanities, and adventuring the loſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the pleaſure of ſin; to have thy portion in this life (where the beſt things are often the lot of the moſt miſerable wretches) and to loſe thy part in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and eternal happineſs; to take up thy eaſe and dwelling here in a neſt of ſtraw of wind and vanity, [the greateſt of Plagues, and foreſt of curſes which God can give thee over to] and to loſe thy part in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and thy Manſion in the heavenly Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>But oh the ſtrange averſneſs of our ſouls from God! that we ſhould account our miſery a happineſs! Nay, that we ſhould rather groan under any intolerable burden and ſervitude, then ſeek our happineſs in him! That we ſhould think theſe Honours delightful, that Beauty tempting, thoſe goods, lands, and houſes, our dependance, that merry company our ſolace, that health and ſtrength contentful, thoſe buildings, walks, apparel, and paſtimes to be pleaſant, and (after all thoſe ſeeming enjoyments, and heart-contenting thoughts) we ſhall look behinde us, and ſee death with open mouth proclaiming theſe words; <hi>Fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee.</hi>

And wilt thou here reſt (oh my ſoul!) on the top of thoſe tempeſtuous mountains? Wilt thou ſwallow down thoſe deceitful baits, where death is neareſt, when the pleaſure ſeems ſweeteſt? Alas!

Yea, we ſhould then ſay of all the moſt raviſhing Objects thereof, How ſenſeleſs was I when I Courted you? O deceitful World!

               <p>Oh my God! If I cannot enter as ſorrowful as I would into my grave, I will yet go repentant into ſome obſcure and ſavage Cave, where the Sun ſhall no more ſhine on a head ſo ſinful as mine, or trace ſome deſart mountains, where with freedom I may pour forth my ſighs and complaints. There will I make that mouth which hath been often the gate of unchaſte and idle ſpeeches, to become a Temple of thy Praiſes.

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:170557:46"/>Briefly, O my God! Since I have ſo betrayed my heart, abuſed my youth, ſpent prodigally thy treaſures, and made Crowns of ſilver to the Idol of my own inventions; ſince I have forſaken thee, who art the unchangeable, eternal, and incomparable goodneſs, (and without whom all other goods are nothing) to follow the wanton fires of my own luſts; where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las? ſhall I finde Tears ſufficient to waſh away my Offences? Where ſhall I finde parts enow of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be offer'd up as the Sacrifice of my Repentance? Waſh me, waſh me again, O my Jeſus! Make clean, I beſeech thee (merciful Saviour!) my moſt ſinful Soul; What though it were as black as hell, yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in thy hands) how ſoon will it become more white then that Dove of ſilver wings, whereof the Prophet ſpeaks!</p>
               <p>Oh my God! Have ſome pity on that heart, which is ſo many times torn in pieces, and ſtrays among ſo great a multitude of Objects, which eſtrange, and draw me from thee! Draw me (O Lord!) from the great throng of ſo many inferiour things, that ſo I may retyre into my own heart, and finde peace in thee.

               <p>Oh ſad change! Ah, my Jeſus! What hath my ſins brought upon thee? Thoſe <hi>Olives,</hi> which were tokens of Peace, did there denounce War againſt thee; the Plants there did groan, the Flowers were flowers of death, and thoſe clear Fountains, were turn'd to fountains of ſweat and blood: What then remains, but that I be now aſhamed of all the fading curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world?

               <p>O my dear Saviour! Let me have no other Will but thine. Wilt thou be abridged of thy own Will,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170557:47"/>to give me an example of mortifying my Paſſions, and ſhall I retain any wicked or inordinate appetite? Haſt thou (like the Dove of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark) eſcaped the Deluge of ſo many Paſſions, and torrents of dolours, falling headlong ſo faſt on one another, to bring me green Olive-branch of peace, and ſhall my ſoul be ſo audacious, as to wage war againſt thee by my ſins? O what earth could then open wide enough to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me! What, thus to live with a hand ſtretched out againſt heaven, which pours out for nothing but Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Roſes? Out alas!</p>
               <p>No, no, Raign (O my dear Saviour!) within all the conquered powers of my Soul. Let thy Wounds be the adored Altars of my Vows: Let me hereupon promiſe an inviolable fidelity to thy ſervice; Let me live no more but for thee, ſince thou makeſt my life to flouriſh with thy tryumphant Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Ah my Soul! Doſt thou want any thing to provoke thy Love? Is there not a Sea of Love here before thee? Caſt thy ſelf in then, and ſwim in the Ocean thereof: Sit no longer under the weeping banks of worldly ſorrow; Thou haſt long ſate mourning with <hi>Hagar,</hi>

               <p>THe Spirit of Man naturally tendeth to God, as its firſt cauſe; neither can take any contentment without him, though too often (indeed) hindered by the weight of the Body, and the bait of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.

               <p>Now the reaſon hereof is, That as every thing tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the imitation of its Original, ſo a Soul [truly Chriſtian] hath all its ſtrength and vigour from God. He is the end of all his works; and if God chance to fail it, the whole Fabrick of its ſalvation falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>When a gracious heart hath its eyes cleared by the Rays of Divine Majeſty, he is at the end of its jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and no longer entertaineth a multiplicity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſince he hath found the Center of Eternal reſt. And well then may the Soul of man, which is out of the Limits which God hath aſſign'd it, finde Inns to lodge in, but never finde a Home to reſide in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170557:48"/>Alas, then what is our life, and the affairs of man?

Oh for that day, when this knowledge of mine [now childiſh and darkſome] ſhall be turned into a full and clear Viſion; O happy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if thus to become lightſome! The more hidden thou art now [bleſſed Saviour!] the more glorious wilt thou be then. Ah, that my heavie thoughts had the wings of an Angel, to ſoar aloft, amongſt thoſe celeſtial Quires!</p>
               <p>Me-thinks I ſee (when thou ſhalt be pleas'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the skreen of my mortal body, which now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains me from thy preſence, and interrupts the view of thy glory) how nothing will be able to hinder the eagerneſs of my Soul, from flying to thee. Me-thinks I ſee Eternity too ſhort to enjoy thee. Surely, there's no poſſibility of pleaſure without thee, no faculty of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170557:50"/>Soul to wiſh, or think any thing but thee; yea, my Soul would more willingly wain into nothing, then part with thee; Thee, my only incomprehenſible and Eternal All, my dear, deareſt Lord and God!</p>
               <p>Adieu then thoſe charming warbles of a fleeting and deceitful world! O merciful Father! Behold my prodigal Soul, which returns unto thee: Receive me as a mercenary ſervant, if thou wilt not receive me as a Son; for I reſolve no longer now to run after the ſalt waters of worldly pleaſures and contentments. The light of thy countenance is far better then life it ſelf, being able to turn the ſhaddows of death into life, and the midnight of the ſharpeſt adverſities into the noon-tide of joy and chearfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh how great is the clemency of God, to hide from us the greateſt part of things which will befal us in the world! The knowledge whereof, would continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally overwhelm our wretched life with ſadneſs and affrightment, and give us no leave to breathe among the delicious Objects of the earth. Had many great and eminent perſons (mounted on the higheſt degree of honour) but ſeen how they were ſtill falling into endleſs Abyſſes; or beheld the change of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the bloody ends of their life, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but the joys of their Tryumphs would have been moiſtned with Tears, and (through a perpetual fear of inevitable neceſſity) they would have loſt all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their felicity.</p>
               <p>And did the poor and ſeemingly forſaken Soul, thorowly at once apprehend the ſevere anger of an omnipotent God, what alas, would it do, when it ſees it ſelf menaced by the hideous and affrightful terrors
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170557:50"/>and miſchiefs of Satan? What ſhall the poor heart do, when God is pleas'd <hi>to write bitter things againſt it; when he ſhall ſcare it with dreams, and terrifie it with Viſions?</hi> Surely, not pains, impriſonments, poverty, or death it ſelf can be more troubleſome to it.</p>
               <p>Whereas the comforts of a quiet conſcience (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed with the gracious in-comes of Gods gracious preſence, and enlightned with his glorious Beams, which expel the darkneſs and ignorance of our curſed Nature) as are ſo many threads of gold, which involve us here below in precious repoſe, and a certain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of beatitude, until at laſt we finde wings to take our flight to the City of Peace and Refuge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto us by that mouth which never erred, and whoſe Laws are eſtabliſhed upon foundations ſtronger then the pillars of heaven and earth, and where we ſhall receive the excellent Promiſes, and cleareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of Eternity.</p>

               <p>See, O my Soul! How that God [far beyond all other created Eſſences] hath been ſo liberal, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow himſelf on thee! He bowed the Heaven, and came down, rendering his ſacred Perſon ſubject to all the miſery of humanity; to bruiſes, to tearings, to ſhatters, to violences, oppoſitions, and tyrannies; and all to accompliſh a King of ſorrow, calamity, and ſcorn. He laid aſide all the Prerogatives of his moſt perfect Soul, expoſing it to labours, to tears, and griefs, to thoſe ſtupendious Throws in the Garden, which made him cry out in thoſe expreſſive words, <hi>My God!

               <p>Ah! what more could he poſſibly have done, then thus to ſuffer for us? He hath waſhed us in his blood, he hath regenerated us into his Love.

But Oh the dulneſs of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, after ſo great a happineſs! How doth thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs accuſe thee of Ingratitude? muſt thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our procure thee Heaven at ſo dear a rate, and wilt thou not more value it? muſt he purchaſe thy life by the Pangs of a bitter death? muſt he go before and prepare a Manſion, and art thou loath to follow? muſt his blood, and pains, and care be loſt? O unworthy and ungrateful Soul! what is loathing, if this be love? Ah wretched Creature, if thou art not aſhamed to neglect ſo great a mercy!</p>

               <p>THe Soul of Man, being embarqued in the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sea of this world, where her adventure is very hazardous, and full of Rocks; and having no Port to put in at, but either Repentance or Death, bewailes the want of her Pilot, without whoſe gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ſhe is ſure to meet with a miſerable ſhipwrack, and which ſhe conceives as natural to her, as ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to Fiſhes, flight to Birds, beauty in Flowers, and rayes in the Sun.</p>
               <p>Woe is me (ſaith he) that ever I was born, to ſee the Light! Why did my Mother rejoyce to hear me cry! and to receive the news that I was a living Soul? when firſt I entered into the world, I bore the Image of my Creator in ſome luſtre and glory; but ſince that time my firſt Parents (who bore (as it were) in one Veſſel, the Riches of all Mankind) had loſt all that, which wretches might loſe, or men deſire, and which (with grief) we yet deplore; its ſcarce diſcernable in me, in regard of thoſe Leaprous ſpots of ſin, and taintures of iniquity which I have contracted from thoſe frail corporeal Organs which have ſo pittifully diſ-figured and transformed me, as that the Character of my God is almoſt loſt in me.</p>
               <p>Alas! I am but an unweildly lump of Earth, a meer paſſive thing of my ſelf! Thoſe eyes of mine which ſhould have been as chriſtal Caſements, through which I might behold the glorious Firmament, and ſtudy my Creator in the Volums of Nature, have let out
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170557:57"/>the Beams of vanity and lightneſs. Thoſe Ears, which ſhould have let in wholſome precepts, and holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, have been no other then Trunks to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive idle diſcourſes, and vain ſounds. That Mouth and Tongue, which ſhould have ſounded out the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and glory of my Creator, and ſung Halelujahs to him, have been inſtruments of Equivocation, Sinne, and Prophaneſs. Thoſe hands which were deſign'd to deeds of Charity, have been employed in evill and ſinful works. That Throat, which was intended as a Conduit-pipe to poure out divine and pious Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hath been made the inſtruments of Luxury and exceſs. And thoſe Feet, which were made to walk in the paths of Piety and Virtue, have been uſed to run into the Road of al Licentiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>But oh! when I examine my heart [the ſeat of my affections] what a ſinck of ſin, a Cage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Birds, do I find it; and whereas I ſhould have made it a Cloſet for my Saviour to ſit and reſide in, alas! what Hatred, what Hypocriſie, what ſpiritual Pride and Choler hath infected every corner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? And if I look further; how ſhall I find every Cell of my Brain infected. My Fantaſy is become wild and extravagant: my Memory hath been more mindfull of bad, then good things; my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of darkneſs, my Will wholly blinded, my Reaſon ſtrangely beſotted, and my Imagination wholly puffed up with airy paſſions, and malignant humours, which interpoſe between me, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beams of my Saviour.</p>
               <p>Ah, whether have the Councels of thoſe tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, which deſire the ruine of my Soul! How am
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170557:58"/>I environed with admires of Luſts, and beſieged with Legions of inordinate affections? Miſerable that I am! what ſhall I do to hinder the deſigns of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Corruptions? Alas! How they prevail againſt me? unhappy that I am! that the Sun which this day ſhines ſo bright over my head, ſhould ſee his face de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with the ſtains of my ſins!</p>
               <p>What do I here in this houſe of Pleaſure, where we ſeem to enter in by five Gates, which are all Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Roſes, and bear the face of youth and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Are not thoſe five Gates, the five Senſes, by which all the paſſages are made into carnal pleaſures, and the vain delights of the world? Is this the way to live like a Chriſtian, to walk according to the Rules and propenſions of Nature? Is this the Babylon of worldly hopes, which in the beginning ſheweth it ſelf as a Miracle, carrying Hony in the lip, Light in the face, but Poyſon in the tail?</p>
               <p>Why, alas! ſhould I thus live in the fervours of a Feaver? why ſhould I deſire to live in that greatneſs, which will onely ſerve to make my fall the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable? Why ſhould I reſt upon thoſe worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, whoſe acquiſition is painful, whoſe fruition uncertain, and taſte unſavory. And how pleaſing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they appear in the dawning of the day, ſeeming in the firſt ſpringing to be ſpread with Emeralds, and Rubies, yet will they at laſt be changed into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours or a ſad Tempeſt, and ever waited on by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and confuſion.</p>
               <p>O that I ſhould thus ſpend the latter part of my age after ſmokes and phantaſtick ſhadows, which will at laſt pay me with nothing but grief! ſhall I flatter my
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170557:58"/>ſelf with the ſpecious hopes of the world, which like Dreams of a delicious Fountain, never quench the Thirſt? Ah, much rather, let me make an Eternal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from all thoſe frivolous worldly hopes! and look on Jeſus, as the Pole-ſtar, alwaies unmovable; let me put my ſelf between the arms of hope, and (amidſt all diſturbances of mind) paſs the veil, and enter the Tabernacle of the Sanctuary, whereinto he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Behold how the Soul is troubled, as if, through ſome melancholly fit, ſhe were fallen into an Abyſs, from which iſſue forth ſuch an infinite quantity of evil va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, as cauſe night in the moſt cheerfull brightneſs, and make the moſt pleaſing Beauties to be beheld with affrightment. The greateſt puniſhment which can befall a ſad and dolorous Soul in this world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in being ſuſpended from the preſence and ſight of God. And as it naturally deſireth to rejoyn it ſelfe unto God, and the leaſt hinderance it feels, is moſt irkſome unto it, ſo how doth it mourn to be deprived of ſo infinite a comfort [which it alone depends on] and to ſee it ſelf bereaved of ſo great a happineſs (even by its own fault) which is the Needle of the Dial, which ſheweth, how our Souls circumvolve times, and the hours of the day.</p>
               <p>And well may ſhe complain of the great diſtance between her, and ſo infinite a bounty, ſeeing the holy Scripture (ſpeaking of Love, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.3.) ſaies, It cauſeth one ſoul to claſpe into another. And truly, did we but once begin to diſlike the world, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to love Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhould almoſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment think upon him; all the moſt pleaſing Objects
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170557:59"/>of the world would ſeem mixed with Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. We ſhould ſeek for our Saviour in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; we ſhould languiſh after him. All that beareth his Name, and memory, will be delightful to him. We ſhall ſpeak of him in all companies, deſire to have him honoured, eſteemed, and acknowledged by all the world; our ſolitude would be in Jeſus, our diſcourſe of Jeſus; Jeſus will be in our watchings, and in our ſleep, in our affairs and Recreations. And Oh! how unwilling will be to loſe ſight of him, though but for a little time.</p>
               <p>Did we but once wipe thoſe eyes, ſurcharged with earthly Beauties, and covered with a thick cloud of the worlds vanities, how ſoon ſhould we fix them upon the infinite love, mercy, and goodneſs of God? How cheerfully vvould our Souls be carried with full flight into the boſome of our Saviour, and be there held in a ſweet Circle of raviſhing contemplations? our hearts would be as flaming Lamps, which perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually burn before the Sanctuary of the living God; we ſhould have but one main deſire in the vvorld, which is God himſelf; all creatures vvhich uſe to be the Objects of our contentments, will never more be the ſubject of our fears.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhould we (like ſilly worms) turn againſt God, when he permitteth any thing to happen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our liking, we would frame unto our ſelves, a life ſimple and free from all affectations; we vvould learn to endure any ſlight oppoſitions vvith great tranquility; vve vvould caſt avvay our vvantonneſs, our pleaſures, and petty peeviſhneſs, neither vvould vve here think our ſelves immortal, ſeeing that every

               <p>Oh horrour then! to ſee men enraged with that avarice, which ſticks to their bones, as doth their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſhall ſleep with them in their Grave? to ſee them pride themſelves in their Garments, which are the food of Mothes! to ſee them glittering with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, which are the excrements of the Sea, and Land; to ſee them carrried in Coaches, and on Horſes, which are the Notes of their poverty, or to ſee them glory in Titles, which are but imaginary Felicities.</p>
               <p>Deceitful Beauties of the world then, where are ye? Ah, true Turrets of Fairies, which are onely in conceit! where ſhall your allurements prevail from henceforth? to what calamity do you reſerve a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life, deprived of ſtrength, and vigour to reſiſt you? and if it have any feeling, it is onely of miſery? How few, alas! are your ſelicities in this world? where your beſt lights have its ſhadows, all fruit its vvorm, and every Beauty fails not to have its embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And vvhere are ye alſo, ye admirers of the fortunes of Glaſs, that happen to the vvicked? where are theſe adorers of the <hi>Coloſſu's,</hi> and heaps of dirt, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the help of falſe gildings, and vvhich are immediately reduced to duſt? Hovv much better had ye been, to have contemplated in that great School of Nature, vvhere God ſpeaketh to us, and teacheth us leſſons through the veil of his Creatures? how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170557:60"/>had ye been, had ye looked upon theſe delights below, as men blind, whereby ye would the better have looked up to heaven, and into your ſelves? that ye had heard of the worlds vanities, as being deaf, and no waies raviſht by them? as diſcourſing of them, and yet no way concerned? Thus ſhould he have been as men in part tranſlated to Heaven, and here become earthly Angels.</p>
               <p>For, Oh! how little doth the pomp of the world ſeem to that Soul, who every day drowns part of his life in Tears, and through long ſolitude hath purged it ſelfe from the impurities of the Earth! Oh, how contemptible do all thoſe Beauties of duſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of wind, ſeem to that heart, which having every day dilated it ſelf in the greatneſſes of God, renders himſelf capable with the viſits, and commerce with Heaven.</p>
               <p>It is time to cloſe the Earth, when God opens Heaven, and to carry our heart where he is, ſince all our Riches are in him. What, alas! have we to do (like Moles) to dig the Earth, and therein to hide our Treaſure? ſurely, he deſerves to be everlaſting poor, who cannot be content with a God, ſo rich as he is. Canſt thou love a little ſhining Earth? Canſt thou love a walking piece of Clay, before that God, that Chriſt, that Glory which is unmeaſurably lovely? Canſt thou love the World, thy Friends, thy Kindred, whoſe love cannot advantage thee, whoſe weeping cannot eaſe thee in the time of thy trouble; and canſt thou not love thy Saviour, vvhoſe Tears and Blood have a healing virtue, and are like Balſome, and waters of life to thy fainting heart.</p>

                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:170557:60"/>Oh my Soul! what incomprehenſible love is here; If love deſerve, and ſhould procure love, oughteſt thou not here to poure out all the ſtore of thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? ſhall he not be firſt ſerved? ſhall he not have the ſtrength of thy love, who parted vvith ſtrength and life in love to thee?

               <p>We read of many accompliſhed Beauties in former ages, which have drawn the affections of thoſe that

Alas! if I can do nothing here without thee, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sun-ſhine of thy preſence, I am but an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervant, and burden to the Earth, what do I here?

               <p>If I cannot reach Heaven, by my own ſtrength, let me go thither by thy love, which is the true gate whereby we enter into the Sanctuary, eternally to enjoy the ſight of the inacceſſible Beauty of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence.

               <p>Never ſuffer me, O Lord! to fill all the ſails of my deſires with the windy vanities of this world, which are more light then Smoak, more ſlippery then Ice; whoſe promiſes are Perjuries, and whoſe perjuries are forſakings.

               <p>I ſee all things which environ me [thoſe Riches, thoſe Pomps, thoſe Honours] are but flitting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, deceitful and momentary things, and ſerve for nothing but Snares and Priſons.

               <p>Enter then into thy heart, O my Soul! and lay thy hand upon thy thoughts, and thou ſhalt find, that all thy unhappineſſe commeth, from being too much tyed to Honours, Ambitions, and worldly Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.

And when Love [like that of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi>] hath thus united their Souls, all the affections and actions of the Soul, to will, to do, to ſay the ſame thing, will ſpeedily follow.</p>

Oh come, Oh come, that happy day! come even now!

               <p>And thrice happy is he, who hath here raiſed his gain from his loſſes; his aſſurance from this worlds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, his ſtrength out of his infirmities, his hopes out of his deſpairs, and is not contented but in God, who can onely ſatisfie his deſires, and Crown him with Felicities!

               <p>The world (I confeſs) thinks it no eaſie matter to truſt Chriſt upon his word, though he have told us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. <hi>His yoak is eaſie, and his burden light.</hi> What (ſay ſome) is it ſo eaſie to renounce all that a man hath [Wealth, Liberty, Life and all] are theſe ſo light? yes, poor Soul! Truth it ſelf hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and moſt true it is, that love makes them both light and eaſie.</p>
               <p>What though thou here ſeem to weep for a time, thou ſhalt but onely reſemble the <hi>Flower-de-luce,</hi> which weeps a little, and out of its own <hi>Tears,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſeeds to renew its Beauty. The ſalt Sea of this world ſhall become a flouriſhing field, as it did to the people of God, when they came out of the chains of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Wee are here in this World, like little Infants, without Air, or Light, beſmeared with blood, and ſwadled in Clouts, which Nature onely gave thee for a time, to fit thee the better for that life, where thou ſhalt for ever breath in all freedom and liberty. We are yet in Priſon, Fetters, and Obſcurity, until the coming of the great day, wherein God ſhall give us a Spiritual body. All the pomp of this World, all our life, yea all that pleaſeth here, and taketh up our heart, is but the ſhadow of that Glorious Beauty,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170557:67"/>and contentment which paſſeth in Eternity.</p>
               <p>Let me then (O my God!) continually exerciſe my ſelf in the deſires of joyes Eternal! let me ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie all other Loves to the love of Jeſus Chriſt; let me forſake all humane things, O my God! and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my ſelf wholly to the conſideration of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. When I ſpeak, let it be of Heaven, as of my reſting place, and of thee as of the Object of my Felicity.</p>
               <p>Ah! what can be more divine, then to ſee a Soul thus capable of the influences of Heaven? whom the Sithe of Time cannot affright; whom the Threats of the world, nor the wheel of Inconſtancy, neither the power of Death can diſmay. O Houſe of God! O Temple of Peace! when will the time come which will deveſt us of all that is mortal, which will ſweeten the bitterneſs of our life, repleniſh our hearts with ſpiritual refreſhment, and at laſt put us into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Immortality?</p>

               <p>Neither doth God do us any injury, if (after long waiting here) inſtead of a Crown, which is the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-cock of winds, of a Scepter, which is the Reed of the times, or of a Life which is the Harbenger of Death, he affords us delights, and glories which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip the flight of Thoughts, which drie up all our Tears, and ſurmount all our Imaginations.</p>
               <p>It was once told a great <hi>Prince</hi> (being in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy bred up in the Houſe of a Peaſant, whoſe Son he took himſelf to be) that he ſhould no longer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſo mean an employment of life; that his Hat ſhould be turned into a Diadem, his Spade into a Scepter, his Raggs into Robes of Gold, his Cottage into a Pallace, and his ſervitude into an Empire. Oh, can we think how he was raviſhed with the love of a Father, by whom he was born to ſo much Treaſure, and Greatneſs! And ſhall we not have the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, when our Saviour tells us, we are not created to live among Mire, and Dirt, to be tyed to a wretched frail and miſerable Body, to walk among Bryars and Thornes, and embroyl our ſelves in the toyls and cares of a mortal life?</p>

               <p>Thou mighteſt (indeed) have made me ambitious, delicate, haughty, covetous, and adorned with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaſures, to have walked on Roſes, to have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifed in delights; yea, made my happineſs ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have out-run my deſires.

But, O mercy! that thou makeſt me to ſee light in the moſt dusky Nights, and a Haven of comfort in the moſt forlorn ſhipwracks:</p>
               <p>O moſt Mighty, O moſt Soveraign Lord of all things, viſible and inviſible! were I with thee, in the ſhades of death, what ſhould I fear, being between the arms of Life; O great eye, who ſeeſt all, and art not ſeen of any here below! Thou art truly worthy (if we with mortal lips may call thee worthy) yea worthy, to whom all the world ſhould give continual thanks, for thy inexplicable Benefits.

               <p>With theſe conſiderations, if the Soul now wholly raviſhed; ſhe walks on Earth, as a man ſuſpended in Heaven, drenched in God, and fill'd with the joyes of his Spirit. Her eyes are liſted up towards Heaven, though ſtreaming down tears for ſinne upon Earth. Her hands are ſtill lifted up thither by prayer. Her heart (formerly contracted with ſadneſs for crimes, committed againſt ſo good a God) now melts with joy unſpeakable. Neither earing, nor drinking, nor ſleeping, is able to diſſolve the ſweet converſation ſhe hath with God.</p>
               <p>Now is it, that the Soul begins to lead a life whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Celeſtial, as one, who ſeems to have nothing to do with the Bodies and converſations of the living.

               <p>Ah ignorant that we are, of the works of God! perpetually fixed to the Earth, and deprived of thoſe ſparkles of heavenly fire, and light!

               <p>Oh what a great Abyſs of <hi>Delights</hi> are reſerved for thoſe purified Souls, who are thus wholly rapt in the contemplation of heavenly Beauties, and altogether raviſhed in the conſideration of Gods divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! No longer do they ſuffer themſelves to be tranſported with earthly proſperities, but (in the midſt of all worldly Pomps) their eyes are firmly fixed upon the many benefits received from God; their Ears being charmed, their Tears wiped, their Fetters broken.

               <p>Yea, there is a love ſo tender in them, and a fear of offending ſo infinite a Saviour, as that, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the leaſt ſhadows of ſinne, as Death.

How willingly do they part, with all the Intereſts of Fleſh and Blood, and all other impediments about

               <p>And what (indeed) can that Soul fear (nay, what can he not hope for) who hath a Jeſus for a Protector, and a God abſolutely powerful, and whoſe power and eſſence walk hand in hand, which is without limits, embraceth all places, and no way confin'd to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Ages, ſince it is Eternal, and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all time?

When he ſleeps, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour [who is more watchful then a million of eyes] wakes for him, when he prayes that voice [which is better then a million of mouthes] makes interceſſion for him. His joyes are pure, his pleaſures innocent, his repoſe dreadleſs, his eating and drinking without
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170557:71"/>fear of poyſon, his Life happy, and his Memory bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Whereas divine Providence (which ſharpens the Sword of Juſtice in the Tears of the miſerable, pours it on the head of the other, conſumes him by ſtrange Maladies; a thouſand hands are ready to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him; his life is a reproach, his memory full of curſings, dung-hills are provided to interre him; yea, the Stones or Mettals afterwards puniſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, for no other crime, but to mention his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſet forth his feature.</p>

               <head>The Soul contemplates, and ſets forth her Folly in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding <hi>Eternal Joyes,</hi> by preferring Earthly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</head>
               <p>AReprobate ſenſe, being the laſt ſtep which any one makes to enter into Hell; O how great is the happineſs of an enlightned Soul, which ſets all the glory of the world at its feet, and preferres <hi>the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and an obedience to his will and command beyond any thing here below which ſhall come in competition with it.</p>
               <p>Often doth ſhe thus expoſtulate with her ſelf; what alas? ſhall the ſight of Temporal Beauty, which too often fills our Soul, with nothing but fire and flames, abate the more fervent love of Eternal things? Is it poſſible that I, ſhould ſo adore my priſon, and fetters here, as to ballance them with the Croſs of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus? who alas! can give me Tears ſufficient, having thus forſaken my God!</p>

Is it poſſible that I ſhould ſuffer my ſelf to be entangled with worldly vanities, which are more brittle then Glaſs, more light then ſmoak, and more ſwift then the wind? that I ſhould fatten my ſelf in earthly Pleaſures; that I ſhould nouriſh this Carrion, this Dunghill of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and neglect, and forget, and deſpiſe my Soul? Oh! what horrid Phantaſms will ſeem to reproach me with ingratitude, when the affairs of my conſcience ſhall be ſet in order, and ſay unto me; I am the Pleaſure thou haſt obeyed; I am the Ambition to which thou wert a ſlave; I am the Covetouſneſs, which was the aim of all thy Actions. Behold thy ſinnes, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by thee; Behold thy iniquities, which thou didſt love ſo much, as to preferre before thy Saviour. Alas! alas! what Comfort, what Happineſs, haſt thou now in all theſe?</p>
               <p>Thus the unhappy Soul (thinking her ſelf undone) cuts off her words, and deeply ſighing, with ſobs of true Repentance, and a lively penetrating grief, (wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelf any thing rather then a Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Paradice will now be nothing unto me; the joyes of Heaven will now but aggravate my grief; what alas then ſhall I do? whether ſhall I turn my ſelf?</p>
               <p>Go then, ye <hi>Worldlings,</hi> go! let Love fool ye, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition rack you, Covetouſneſs ruſt ye, Luſt inflame ye, Hope tickle ye, Pleaſure melt ye; Let Anger burn, Envy gnaw, and Jealouſie prick ye, Revenge exaſperate, Cruelty harden, Fear ſreez, and ſorrow conſume ye. Yet know, that one day ye will wiſh to have deveſted your ſelves of all your worldly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that ye had loved nothing, but for God, of God, and to God.</p>

Alas! poor Soul! that thou ſhouldeſt purchaſe Repentance ſo dear, to give up the expectation of Eternity, and the fruition of ſo many glorious years, as a prey to one unhappy minute of pleaſure! Where is thy faith which thou haſt promiſed to God? where is thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs to avoid ſinne? Doſt thou think that God doth not ſee thee ſinning?</p>
               <p>The time is drawing on, when Death ſhall ſtrip thee to the very skin, and leave thee nothing but what thou haſt done, and given for God.

               <p>But on the contrary, how ſad will it be, when thy conſcience [which as <hi>Phylo</hi> terms it, is the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170557:73"/>of the ſoul] ſhall ſit on a Throne, with a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her hand, and ſay unto thee; wicked Servant! recall thy Thoughts, Words, and Actions; how haſt thou miſpent the time of thy life? how many dayes haſt thou careleſly loſt? what ſluggiſhneſs at thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? what negligence in thy employment? how great Words, and how little Works,? Why this raſh judgement, that curious queſtion? theſe wandering eyes? theſe ſtragling thoughts? this angry paſſion? that haſty ſlander? why this dayes intemperance? that dayes exceſs? this dayes neglect of thy God? that dayes uncharitableneſs to thy Neighbour?</p>
               <p>Oh how ſad will theſe expreſſions be at the laſt day! Curſed Atheiſm! why wouldſt thou rather feel thy torments, then believe them? Cruel Ambition! to vvhat paſs haſt thou brought me? deceitful Riches! how have ye beguilded me? wicked Company, vain Companions, worldly Pleaſures! how have ye been the chains of my Ruine? Alas! how can I write, or how canſt thou hear, or read this vvithout trembling, to think on thy forlorn condition? Poor vvretch! vvhat vvill become of thee, vvhen thou ſhall look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thee, and ſee the God which hath forſaken thee, the Saints whom thou haſt deſpiſed, and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at the right hand of Glory? vvhen thou ſhalt look below, and ſee thoſe hideous flames which thou muſt a bide for ever? vvretched Soul vvhat vvouldſt thou now give for a Chriſt, vvhich onely can [but will not] ſave thee? vvhat vvould thou give for one hours time of repentance? which once thou ſlep'ſt under, refuſedſt, and eſteemedſt of no value.</p>
               <p>Then wilt thou ſay unto thy ſelf; O God! O God!
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170557:73"/>whom have I loſt, yet cannot loſe? I have loſt thee as my Saviour, yet have thee ſtill preſent, beholding my pains. O Eternity! ſhall there never be end of my evils? ſhall thoſe Torments be alwaies beginning? Ah, why was not the womb of my Mother the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of my birth? Why did not the Stars which then ruled, throw the ſparkles of their influences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me? why did not the Earth ſwallow me up in my Cradle? muſt I live one ſole minute on earth, to live an Enemy to God eternally? Ah Lord! what a depth is there in thy judgement! let ſilence ſmother the remainder of my complaints, ſince I can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endure my ſelf, nor my Tongue make known the conceptions of my heart!</p>
               <p>Neither canſt thou juſtly complain (poor Soul, whatſoever thou be!) that God did thee wrong in making ſuch a hell for thee, ſeeing thy ſinne hath neither end, nor limits in its Eternity. It is an infinite evil, becauſ it ſtrikes at the head of an infinite Divinity. Wilt thou ſay to an Omnipotent God, thou createdſt me to ſerve thee, but I will live for my ſelfe? Thou maidſt a World for my uſe, but I wil fill it with my ſins; thou redeemedſt me with thy blood, but I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and trample it under my my feet. O horrible confuſion! O unſpeakable wickedneſs!</p>
               <p>No way of redreſs then is there left thee (O poor Soul!) but to live alwaies in a ſtate, wherein thou wouldſt die; to fear Hell always that thou maiſt not fear it ar all; to frame a tender and timerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to thy ſelf, and to call thy ſelf often to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in this manner. Ah poor Soul! if thou wert now at this inſtant to diſlodge out of this world; art
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170557:74"/>thou in an eſtate to be preſented before the Throne of the ſupream Judge? haſt thou not ſome ſinnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, ſome reſtitution to make? do there not ſome vain thoughts and worldly luſts lodge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main within thy heart?</p>
               <p>Say further to thy ſelf; alas! what is a little time when it is gone? how quickly ſhall I be in another world? how ſpeedily will our years paſs? how will our minutes of pleaſure be then repaid with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſufferings? what have I then to do, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for heaven? And let me think that time loſt, wherein Nothing is done to that end. And ſeeing all the pleaſure of ſinne here in this world, is but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Swine, and feed on Husks. O that we had but a right apprehenſion of the fulneſs and pollution thereof, and how momentary and uncertain that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is vvhich vve reap by it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Soul (being ready to ſink under the weight and apprehenſion of her Sins) bemoanes the weakneſs of her <hi>Faith,</hi> and deſires help from her Saviour.</head>
               <p>THough Proſperity, and the Beauty of the world, doth not eaſily corrupt Souls, which have once taken upon them to live in the fear of God; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they oftentimes vvould, and in ſome ſort change them, every ſin being a tripping off of the Souls heels.</p>
               <p>The poor labouring and induſtrious Bee, ſometimes goes ſo long upon her hony, as that by much walking ſhe there entangles her feet. So a Soul [yea one of thoſe who are moſt devout] being continually ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170557:74"/>by a long ſequel of pleaſing ſucceſſes, and the delights of the world, taketh ſome ſmall flight out of it ſelf, and ſeeketh content in the ſmiling and delicate aire of the worlds delights, though at laſt they prove nothing but the Objects of grief and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner doth adverſity ſtrike, and God hold up his finger, but the Soul re-entereth into it ſelf, it raiſeth it ſelf above the wayes of the Moon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Sun, to the goodly Temple of Eternity, where Spirits live diſpoiled from theſe Maſſes of fleſh and Bones which we draw along with us, in the midſt of the various revolutions of this mortal life. This is the way which the Soul taketh, ſo ſoon as (through ſinne) ſhe is alienated from the Court of Heaven. She entereth into a ſad retirement, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beſpeaks her ſelf.</p>
               <p>O Lord, this World is irkſome to me; I cry unto thee, Lord! unto thee do I fly. O thou whoſe cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency reacheth from Heaven to Earth, ſet my ſinnes from me, as wide as the Eaſt is from the Weſt. It is thou onely, O Jeſus! that canſt cure the ardours of my Sufferings. It is thou onely, that canſt dry up my Tears, break my Fetters, and diſſipate all my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. If I am in darkneſs, thou art light; if in doubt, thou art my councel; if in danger of ſhipwrack, thou art my Haven; if in a Labyrinth of Dangers, thou art the Thread to guide me out; yea, if at the Gates of death, thou art my Life! O ſuffer me not, dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! now to ſink under the grievous weight of my many infirmities!</p>
               <p>Then ſhe looks about her, as if it ſeemed Nature had diſplayed the Mountains &amp; Valleys, the Woods,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170557:75"/>Forreſts, and Rivers, and the great Theatre of the works of God, altogether to aſſiſt and further her in the height of her ſadneſs. She that formerly ſeemed like thoſe, that ſhined in the Majeſty of ſumptuous attire, was now covered with courſe Cloth. She who ſeemed like thoſe that altogether ſparkled with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones appeared now in a Livery of Sackcloth; and ſince he had formerly entertained a mortal beauty, was now wholly taken up, and waſted with ſadneſs, and mortification of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Methinks I hear how the Soul (reaſoning with her ſelf, and being ever perplexed and involved, finding pain in repoſe, thirſt in abundance, and ſeeming ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the fountain of true comfort) ſadly cries out; My God! I know that no good can be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, the true and ſoveraign Good! In every place that I am without thee, I am in pain. All the Riches which are not in thee, ſeem to be meer pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; All the greatneſs, pleaſures, and profits of the World are nothing to me, unleſs I can call thee Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. From thee onely comes that joy, which all the Saints have ſtudied, with pain, with delight, and taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Glory. It is that which S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>A joy vnſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> It is that which S. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, contained the conſummation of all comforts, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.2. which S. <hi>Paul</hi> found in the Caverns of the Earth, which ſome have found upon Wheels, others in Flames, ſome in Gibbets, others on Gredirons; and laſtly, it is that which deſcenderh from Heaven, and with Eternal ſtreams of comfort watereth the dry and parched hearts of diſtreſſed Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170557:75"/>Thus was the divine Soul, like the Moon in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe, which appeareth wholly dark on the ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Earth, but faileth not to be moſt bright in that part which looketh towards Heaven. And though ſome who behold her with carnal eyes, in ſuch a ſtate, may think her totally darkned; yet God, in this retirement and ſweetneſs of repoſe, darts his glorious Rayes upon her, through the Cloud of the Body, and cauſeth her to ſee the eyes of Angels, as a Soul wholly inveſted with the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, ſhe reliſheth this retreat, as <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, and taſteth this deep ſilence, with incredible delight, after ſo many confuſed cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of a troubled Conſcience. It ſeemeth unto her, that ſhe then ſpeaks to God face to face, and that ſhe ſaw all the pride of the Earth much lower then her feet. Her Soul was whitened in her Tears, and purified in her deſires, pouring out all unto God, as it were through the Limbeck of her ardent Devotion, and drawing the Curtain over all worldly affairs, to be onely entertained with God.</p>
               <p>And from this time forward, ſhe lives beyond the ſenſe of worldly affections. <hi>Time</hi> ſeems to have no <hi>Sythe</hi> for her; Death is unprovided with Darts? Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny loſeth its Teeth at her, and Glory ſpreads throughout the Enſigns of Immortality. She ſeems onely to live on Extaſies, turning that little breath which remained on her lips, to the praiſes of God. She now alſo ſees it a matter very reaſonable, that God ſhould make uſe of all manner of Arms, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a Fugitive from his Providence, who hath made a divore from its Creator, and ſeeks to ſave himſelf in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170557:76"/>a Region of nothing. She can bethink of no better way to purifie thoſe eyes, then with tears, which are now wholly bent towards Heaven; neither any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe then mortifyings, and faſtings, to whither the beautiful Roſes of her face; and at laſt to give up that amorous heart which hath been the corrupt fountain of ſo many Luſts, onely to be waſhed, and clenſed with the blood of her Saviour.</p>
               <p>O Lord (ſaid ſhe) my heart was created for thee, and it will be reſtleſs until it return unto thee! Do I hunger? thou art the bread of life. Do I thirſt, thou art the <hi>waters whereof whoſoever drinks ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Am I Naked? thy Righteouſneſs is my Robe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Thou art a Refuge from the ſtorm, and a ſhadow from the heat.</hi> If I am Ignorant, thou art Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>to know thee, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent is Eternal life,</hi> Joh. 17.3. Since therefore all things are nothing unto me, without thy ſelf, be thou all things unto me. O God! true God, of my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! my heart which feels it ſelf moved with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate zeal, thinks alwaies upon thee. O let the breathings of my heart fill my lips with the ſounds of Love! <hi>The

               <p>Love is the commanding affection of the Soul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the expanſion, and going out of the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a perſon or thing it wiſhes well to. It is the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> of the Soul, and ſits upon the Throne, commanding all; where then can the diſtreſſed Soul

He is our Phyſick, and who ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him but ſuch as are diſeaſed?</p>
               <p>In this manner will the Soul, which is ever longing after her Saviour, be ever ſeriouſly meditating upon the ſpotleſs innocence, and unblameable converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Lord and Maſter. It will conſider what it is, through the defilement of ſinne; it will frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe with the word of God; it will ſtill keep communion with God in prayer, it will often parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of his holy Supper; and if at any time it be ſurpriſed with Temptation, and overtaken in a fault, oh how vigilant is it at all times, and in all places [privately by her ſelf, and publickly with others.] And when any inordinate Paſſion, Luſt, or Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, doth begin to ſtir in her, how doth ſhe fly to the rich mercy and free Grace of her Saviour, for ſtrength to cruſh it, in the very firſt riſing, that ſhe be not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ovet to impetuous deſires, nor that ſinnes of a high hand get dominion over her.</p>
               <p>The thoughts alſo of a Gracious Soul, will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver frequent towards Jeſus Chriſt. If ſhe lie down, all things are commended to his protection. If ſhe riſe, ſhe deſireth his guidance. If ſhe read, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, ſhe craves his help. If ſhe ear, ſhe intreates his bleſſing. When ſhe is ſatisfied, ſhe praiſeth his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170557:77"/>In the beginning of her Work, ſhe labours in his fear; in the end thereof ſhe referres it to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In ſcarcity, ſhe is contented with his fulneſs; in plenty, ſhe diſtributeth it to his Glory. All things are nothing without him, and he is all things unto her, if ſhe have nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>And though ſhe oftentimes labour under ſpirituall affliction, when God is pleaſed to turn her mid-day into Night, and many times afflict her with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs in her Soul, yet will ſhe ſtill be ſetting forth the praiſes of her God. If ſhe cannot chant with the Nightingale, ſhe will chirp with the Black-bird; ſhe'l chatter with the Swallow, yea croak with the Raven, rather then the ſighes and groans of her heart ſhall want pouring out. A ſerious ſurvey of her manifold ſlips and failings ſhall be taken. She will be deeply humbled, loathing and deteſting what ſhe hath done amiſs, confeſſing her offences with a mournful heart, and a weeping eye, unto the Redeemer of Men, who onely is able to comfort her.</p>
               <p>How doth ſhe complain, that her ſinnes have even excluded all the comforts of her God, and all his Graces from her Soul? once ſhe injoyed a ſweet communion with him, but now ſhe ſinks in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of ſorrow. For why? he paſſeth by as a Wayfaring man, is become a ſtranger to her, and takes her for his Enemy. Ah, they are my ſins, they are my ſins, (ſaith ſhe) which have thus occaſion'd the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment of my Saviour! And what? ſhall my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt comforts be thus driven away by my ſelf? woe is me, that I am conſtrained to live in thy Anger, and to have ſuch a ſad habitation in the dark Tents of thy heavy diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:170557:77"/>My God! my God! why comes thy wrath ſo faſt upon me? O what Billowes of diſquietneſs. ariſe within my heart! what ſad thoughts ariſe within my Soul? I know not what to doe, I know not what to anſwer, ſo unworthy am I, not having any thing in me to move thy affections to me. Alas! how unfit am I to perform any ſervice to thee? How dull, how poor, and liveleſs therein? yea with what vanity and diſtractions, are my beſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accompanied? And will Chriſt ſtoop to uphold ſuch a worm as I am?

Why ſhouldſt thou not bend all thy affections to Jeſus, who is onely able to delight thee? Why ſhouldſt not thou be enamoured of his Beauties? Why ſhouldſt thou not ſigh after his Attractives?

How pleaſant a thing alſo is it to behold thoſe goodly Forreſts, to trace thoſe flouriſhing Woods, to be delighted with the murmuring Waters, to hear the pleaſant notes and warbling of Birds, in the ſweetneſs of ſolitude, and retirement.</p>
               <p>But, O my Soul! reſt not here. Let thy Spirit fly to that hidden Spirit, which thus diſtributeth it ſelf through ſo many melodious Diviſions throughout the whole world.

               <p>And how (a thouſand times) wilt thou bleſs the

Why do I not fly away, weigh Anchor, ſet Sails, and go forward towards my Eternal happineſs? Shall I create unto my ſelf an Empire in my Baniſhment? ſhall I ſuppoſe my ſelf in a Haven, in the midſt of ſhipwrack? ſurely the Soul, which is raviſhed with the contemplation of Heaven, will not ſtay upon Fleſh.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170557:84"/>the truth of his Promiſes; but becauſe (at ſuch times) the Soul cannot ſo plainly ſee it; it looks upon its ſinnes in a multiplying-Glaſs, and in the gloomy day of Affliction, is ready to behold them, as an evidence that it wants that intereſt in God, it ſhould have, and thinks (with <hi>David,</hi> and the Church) it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.2. &amp; 44, 9, &amp; 80, 1.</p>
               <p>But after thoſe fainting and ſoul-ſwounding fits, and too much eying and poaring on ſin, without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the nature of God in his Covenant, when the poor Soul, as well looks upwards with one eye towards Gods mercy, as with the other downward on her ſins, ſhe is kept from being over-powred with Satans temptations; ſhe concludes there is yet ſome help in her God; ſhe ſtill layes hold on the merits of her Saviour. And however her ſtomack may be gone for a time, yet (when ſhe awakes out of her ſpiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion) ſhe cryes out, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, though I knew it not. Pſ.</hi> 4.3.8 I ſhall again ſit at <hi>Davids</hi> Table, who bids me to come and <hi>taſte, and ſee how good the Lord is.</hi> Fear not (O Spouſe) thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is not wholly departed; Be not troubled if thy journey to <hi>Canaan</hi> be through the wilderneſs of this world, and if (in thy way to Sion) thou paſs through the valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> ſince Chriſt is a Cloud and Pillar to direct thee.</p>
               <p>Thus by the Gates of Hell, doth God oftentimes ſhew us the way to Heaven. He (who is not tyed alwayes to bring a Soul thither by one and the ſame Road) can make Death the way to life. The Sun of Righteouſneſs is ſtil bright, though behind a Cloud, and not ſeen to us. The Nurſe is withdrawn oftentimes,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170557:85"/>that the Mother may get the chiefeſt affections of the Child. And though God leave a poor Soul, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Pangs of Deſertion; yet (through the Sun-ſhine of Gods countenance ripening its Graces) cloudy weather ſtill advantageth her growth, and her Barrenneſs, at laſt yeelds a fruitful Harveſt; Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief comming alwaies in the beſt time, and ſhe pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attends his help from Heaven, even until the fourth [which is the laſt] watch of the Night.</p>
               <p>And when (vvith <hi>Peter</hi>) ſhe is freed out of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſtrong Temptation, and God is pleaſed to come in unto her, with abundance of comfort: Oh! how is ſhe raiſed to bleſs the Lord, who hath forgiven her ſinnes, and healed all her infirmities! The waves of Terrours, and flouds of Afflictions, never beat ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently upon her, neither did ſhe ſo much complain of ſpiritual wants, as now ſhe ſaw the wonders of God in the deep, and the infinitenefs of his Wiſdom in the diſpenſations of comfort, and joy, of grief, and terrour. The Souls complaint, now is no longer, <hi>Where is my God become?</hi> or that, <hi>There is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her fleſh, becauſe of his anger.</hi> All her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſeem but as ſo much Phyſick, to clenſe her from her manifold ſins: Yea, ſhe now ſeems even drown'd in ſweetneſs, and (in ſinking, cryes out; Oh the breadth of thy unfathomable love! what Saint; what Tongue, what Angel, can ſpeak out thy unexpreſſible kindneſs?
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.17.</note> Thou haſt looſed my Bonds, Oh that my heart could burn in love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee! Oh that I could (as I deſire) make known to others, hovv good thou haſt been to me! in preſerving, ſtrengthning, and fixing my fiath on
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170557:85"/>a Rock, not to be over-born vvith the ſtorms, and ſwelling Surges of Satans Temptations!</p>
               <p>Methinks I meet thee every where (O bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus!) with a hundred arms unfolded, to do me good! what place, what time, what moment, is not filled vvith thy Bounty? Though paſſions have (for a time) aſſailed my mind, and thy Terrours have affrighted my ſpirits; yet behold, now thy Grace hath ſhot through the dark Clouds of my Sin, and doubting, thy Darts have pierced the Center of my heart, with quickning ſparklings, my ſpirits are come again: Ah, how my Soul is fill'd with joy, raviſhment, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Oh God! who is he, who beholds the fading ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the world [this diſmal place, where cares and ſorrows are ſtill growing young, and never die] that would ever betray his Soul, Heaven, and his God, to yield obedience thereunto? who vvould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray an Eternity of bleſſing, for a Pleaſure ſo ſhort, and wretched? who would build Tabernacles here, to loſe a Manſion among Celeſtial Souls, where Love onely Reigns? who would not give a farewel to thoſe earthly Cottages, to aſcend thoſe mounts of Bliſs, vvhere every ſeaſon is a conſtant Spring? who vvould deſire to make his name great here on Earth, and deſire to have them enrolled among the Saints in Heaven?</p>
               <p>O what Celeſtial mirth! what an expanſion of all the faculties of the Spirit; yea, what rejoycing is there in the heart of Man, vvhen Chriſt begins to make it his Throne? all Powers do him homage, all Paſſions render him ſervice. Who can conceive what joy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170557:86"/>in the Soul, vvhen Jeſus is pleaſed to take up his lodging in it? Hovv is the heart excited, awakened, and enflamed towards Heaven? what diſtaſte is there of all things in the world? It is as light to bleared eyes; It is as food to hungry Travellers; It is the repoſe to the wearied, the Country of poor Pilgrims, and the Crown of all our happineſs.</p>
               <p>Nothing but Fires, Deſires, Sweetneſs, Affections, Joyes, and Admirations, will tranſport our Souls, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once regained our wel-beloved; our thoughts will wholly be employed upon Jeſus, we ſhall be dead and inſenſible to all the Objects of the world. All the Thornes wherewith it is encompaſſed, will ſeem as Roſes. If we ſwim in the Tears of Wotmwood, it will be no other then ſweet water. All the wounds we receive will be but like Rubies and Pearls. Our Maladies will prove but ſports; our Calumnies will be our bleſſings; yea, Death it ſelf no other then a happy life.</p>
               <p>When the Soul ſleeps, Jeſus is in her ſleep; vvhen ſhe ſpeaks, Jeſus is under her Tongue; when ſhe Writes, Jeſus is under her Pen; and when ſhe is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe chaunts forth the praiſes of her Jeſus; in her ſolitude, ſhe ſeems all environed with Raptures. And vvhen any reproves her for being alone, ſhe cries out, nothing leſs, before ſhe vvas interrupted with their company. In the morning ſhe grieves to think, how often ſhe ſhall offend God before Night. Being about to reſt, ſhe bitterly (vvith ſcalding Tears) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhe ſhall have no more power over her Dreams, but offend her Saviour while ſhe ſlept.</p>
               <p>Thus is her mind alwayes running after her dear
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170557:86"/>Spouſe. Se is in a priſon of Love, vvhere her Thoughts, her Hopes, her Joyes, were Chains. And ſtill doth ſhe elevate her ſelf upon the wings of Faith, in the higheſt poſtures ſhe can towards Heaven, taking the choiſeſt affections vvith her, vvhereby to aſcend that Mountain of pure and inexpreſſible light. She vvell knew, that true Pleaſure, vvas to be found no vvhere, but in God, vvhoſe Joyes are like thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens which never vvither, but are perpetually watered vvith immortal Graces. And oh! How [if it vvere poſſible] vvould ſhe expreſs her love to him by daily offering her ſelf a hundred times for him, in as many Sacrifices as ſhe hath Thoughts, and Body, Members!</p>
               <p>Never Ship (laden vvith Gold) arrived more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Haven (after many tedious Tempeſts, and a thouſand diſaſters among Pirates at Sea) as the poor ſoul novv ſeems to take content in the love of God. And having ſpun out all the Web, vvhich he gave her, cryes out, I have ended all, the hopes of the vvorld! why ſtayeſt thou O my God! to receive my Soul, which I bear in my lips? O Jeſus! at whoſe name the Heaven; the Earth, and Hell, do bend the knee! I now care not what I ſuffer for thee, ſo I ſin not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, ſo I may for ever injoy thee!</p>
               <p>Thus the love of God is like Lightning in a Cloud, ſtill ſtriving to break forth; and ſuffers the Soul to take little reſt in any thing, but what it undertakes for the glory of her Maker, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. who many times defers the cure, that his power may be the more manifeſt; the heats of affliction, being but the chafing of thewax whereby he means to ſeal us nearer to himſelf, and the ſpots of our infirmities, but the Letters wherein
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170557:87"/>to write his Name. He makes his ſervants more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their ſufferings, then actions; yea, makes them remarkable (with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5.) <hi>In much Patience, in Afflictions, in Neceſſities, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, in Stripes, in Impriſonments, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as in worldly Amities, it is not enough to have affections, languours, and lip complements, without ſome better effects; ſo the Souls love conſiſteth not in ſlight affectations, or idle Devotion. She knows that whoſoever doth truly love, muſt ſerve Jeſus, whoſe will muſt be executed, his Croſs carried, and our ſelves wholly transformed into him, by imitation of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. She looks no more upon a withered and rotten Gourd, upon the ſeducements and flatteries of a moſt odious and decayed Proſtitute. But Heaven is ſtill in her Eye, where wealth, without want; delight without diſtaſte, and joy without ſorrow (like unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and uncorruptible Virgins) ſit cloathed and crowned with Glory.</p>
               <p>A devout Soul, reſembles thoſe Rivers, which run under the Earth. It ſteals from the eyes of the world, to ſeek for the eyes of God. It ſtudies ſolitude and retirement, and is wholly ſhut up within it ſelf. Whence it often happens, that thoſe of whom we ſpeak leaſt on Earth, are the beſt known in Heaven; and while the world thinks they lie upon Thornes, their Beds are made of Roſes. Yea, God uſually makes Ladders and Footſtools of our Tribulations, to lead us unto Heaven.</p>
               <p>Happy then, is that life, which hath no eyes for carnal Beauties! it being a ſhame for us ſtill to tread on Flowers, and think to attain Heaven, without being
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170557:87"/>acquainted with the troubles of Earth, to be embarqued in the great Ship of Chriſtianity, and not ſometimes to caſt our eyes on the Rocks; but (like <hi>Jonah</hi> and the <hi>outcaſts</hi> from Gods <hi>Preſence</hi>) to ſleep ſecurely under the Hatches.</p>
               <p>And for ever bleſſed is that life, which is no way dazeled with the ſun-ſhine of worldly vanities! How freely doth it taſte the comforts of Heaven? How doth it forſake the painted pieces of the world? what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will it [one day] take in this one Pleaſure? what joy is it to derive all our Joys from this one Fountain? Why ſay we not then with S. <hi>Auſtin? O Fountain of Life, when ſhall we come to thy Delights, and eternall ſweetneſs! I ſigh here on Earth [holy Hieruſaleus] in a dry Land! O dear City! with weeping eyes, we behold thee afar off!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tell me then (if thou canſt) O fond worldling! what is it that thou ſo ſtrangely ſets thy thoughts on? What, alas! is it that thou ſo paſſionately ſeekeſt? Wilt thou have Honours? who hath more then God, to whom ſo many States, Kingdoms, and Empires are but a drop of dew? Haſt thou high thoughts with thy ſelf, who more high then thy Saviour, who makes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to bow under the ſhadow of his Majeſty, who ſits upon Thrones, and ſhall at laſt come with his Angels to judge the World? Oh, but thou wouldſt have power in thy hands! Alas who more great then this Judge, who makes the Thunder to roar, the Lightning to fly, the Rocks to rent, the Earth to quake, the Elements to melt; there being neither Place, Time, nor Power, which can deliver any out of his hands? If wiſdome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thee, who more wiſe then that God who hath the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170557:88"/>Riches of Eternal wiſdom, who ſeeth all within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to whom all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, are [at one inſtant] repreſented?</p>
               <p>But it may be (O wavering Soul!) thou art wearied with the cares, griefs, vexations, and anxieties of the world; If ſo, where canſt thou find repoſe out of God? Hath he not all the contentments for the Soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? But thou ſaiſt again, thou art no body without Pleaſures; yea, the deſires of thy heart, are unſatisfied without them. And is there not a fulneſs of joy in thy dear Saviour? Is he not an abundance, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails; a ſweetneſs, which never corrupteth, a Feaſt which never conſumes? Is he not a perpetual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of Comforts, and an unexhauſtible fountain of all contentments?</p>
               <p>Methinks (oh unſatisfied Soul!) I hear thee yet further to complain, thou wanteſt Riches. And doſt thou think to receive them anyway, but from him who poſſeſſeth all? He is the Beauty of fields, the luſtre of Flowers, the pleaſantneſs of Fruits, the wealth of Minerals, and the Magazin of total Nature? Cannot he, whoſe care it is every year to make Garments, all beſprinkled over with the pearls of ſo many Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow flowers, ſatiate thy hungry deſires?</p>
               <p>Surely, would we but thus, by continual familiarity, adore that moſt pure Spirit which thus enlivens us, and diſperſeth it ſelf throughout the whole world, we ſhould not look upon the Sun, but break out into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for that eternal Light, wherein there is neither blemiſh nor darkneſs. We ſhould not behold the Sea, but admire the ſecret depths of the Judgements of God, We ſhould not caſt our eyes upon the Fields,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170557:88"/>but [in ſo many ſorts of Hearbs and Flowers different in colour, and quality] behold the beautiful eyes of him that hath ordained them; neither ſhould we hear a Bird to ſing, but we will conceit it to ſpeak the love of our Maker.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Soul being re-advanced on the wings of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſends up her choiceſt Affections towards Heaven.</head>
               <p>THoſe that are throughly wounded with heavenly love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. are ſending out their ſighs and groans, their thoughts and tears, to ſeek out the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved of their Souls. No return, nor Letter pleaſeth them wherein the Name of Jeſus is not compriſed. They pretend not any more to the Greatneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, after their former affliction, but throw themſelves, between the arms of the Croſs, that they may there find thoſe of their Saviour, daily diſſolving themſelves into Tears, and meeting no comfort but in the wounds of their Saviour, and a heavenly Retirement.</p>
               <p>And O how great is the comfort, in ſeeking the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of our wounds, in the Mercies of an infinite God! who [being in his Nature moſt wiſe and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful] hath not ſo given man over, as a prey to grief and calamities, but hath [withal] reſerved a life of ſpirits to himſelf, whereby to pleaſe and adore him. He wipes the eyes of thoſe that are his (ſo many times drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Tears) and makes them ſee (through their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſufferings) a glory and happineſs not imaginable, which expects their Soul in another life.</p>
               <p>Ah welcome, welcome, that affliction which is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170557:89"/>from our Saviours Love! Happy is that chaſtiſment which comes from ſo fatherly a hand! What though I ſmart, though I bleed under the ſtripes of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father? ſure there cannot be ſo much pain in them, as comfort in the love of him that layes them on. Did he not <hi>uſe to chaſtiſe every one whom he doth receive, Heb.</hi> 12.6, 8. Alas! I might ſuſpect my ſelf? But O repining Soul! muſt thou alwayes feed upon dainties? will not the Crums which fall from thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Table, ſometimes ſuffice thee? Canſt thou not be content to touch the <hi>Hem of his Garment?</hi> Haſt thou eaten ſo plentifully of the <hi>Loaves</hi> of his mercy, &amp; canſt thou not ſometimes be content to <hi>faſt</hi> with him in the <hi>Wilderneſs?</hi> Wilt thou be with him in the Calm, and not (with <hi>Peter</hi>) adventure to him on the waves of Trouble?</p>
               <p>Thus doth the poor Soul often check her ſelf for her great faintneſs under the power of ſome affliction. But though ſhe ſee it a ſad thing to <hi>row,</hi> where Jeſus is not in the <hi>Boat,</hi> yet at laſt ſhe finds all things to fall out aright with thoſe who embarque with him! If he once ſay, <hi>It is I, be not afraid, Mat.</hi> 14.6.26. How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth the ſtorm of temptation ceaſe? Nothing ſeems grievous to a ſincere Chriſtian, ſo as (at laſt, with the Apoſtle) <hi>he may finiſh his courſe with Joy.</hi> He is like a Pearl coming out of the ſalt Sea, beholding himſelf involved (almoſt from his birth) in great acerbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and horrible confuſions, from whence he mounts with ſo much luſtre, as to make his adverſities the ſteps to the Temple of Glory.</p>
               <p>That Soul, which hath brought it ſelf to love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and to deſpiſe all, in compariſon of him, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170557:89"/>accounts it ſelf unhappy, if [for one moment of time] diverted from the ſweet Idea's, and moſt ſublime thoughts of his perſon, will with comfort, paſs over all the troubles and acerbities ſuffered in in his ſervice, perpetually languiſhing with moſt ardent deſires, to behold him face to face.</p>
               <p>Have you never ſeen thoſe poor Tulips in a Garden, ſhut up with melancholly under the ſhadie coldneſs of the night, which in the next morning have been (as it were) unlock with the Key of the Suns Rayes? Juſt ſo doth it happen to thoſe drooping Souls, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem benummed and frozen through the want of that <hi>Preſence,</hi> which at laſt enlivens them with great refreſhment and cheerfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Who would have thought that <hi>Jonah,</hi> when (contrary to the advice of his Maſter) he would turn Polititian, and fly from his Preſence, ſhould forthwith be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the greedy Ocean; yet behold (when the Tempeſt purſued him, the Sea raged on him) the Belly of a Whale which we thought his Sepulcher, became his Palace, &amp; wherein had he not been buried, he had dyed.</p>
               <p>Sure there is, I know not what kind of charm, in holy ſadneſſes, which cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed; but ſuch it is, that a Soul [contriſtated from God] when it is fallen into thoſe <hi>Abyſſes,</hi> wherein all the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes it loſt, findeth in the bottom of its heart, ſuch lights and ſweetneſſes, as that there is not any comfort in the world to be compared with them.</p>
               <p>Still is the dejected Soul crying out, My God! I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore thy holy Providence, which ſometimes drencheth me with Gall and Wormwood, in an age wherein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are accuſtomed to vvalk on Roſes! Thou know'ſt (O Lord!) that my pride hath need of ſuch a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poiſe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170557:90"/>and in all equity, haſt thou done that, which thy wiſdom thought good. What though mine eyes are moiſtned, and fail not every night to pour forth ſtreaming Rivers? Is it reaſon I ſhould live without ſome light hurt, ſeeing thee wounded on all ſides for my example? Can I receive or take contentment in the hopes of a better fortune? Where ſhould I gather thoſe pleaſures that I ſhall (at laſt) in joy in thee? Its true; I am yet upon the weeping banks of the River of <hi>Babylon;</hi> But ſince thou haſt (at laſt) promiſed to wipe off thoſe Tears, ſince thou haſt told me, <hi>Thy yoke is eaſie, and thy burden light,</hi> and haſt at laſt promiſed to eaſe <hi>all thoſe that labour and are heavy laden;</hi> why ſhould I not fix all my conſolations and ſongs at the feet of thy Croſs? why ſhould I deſire any thing more in the world, then the performance of thy holy will?</p>
               <p>Obſerve then, whoſoever thou art that readeſt theſe lines, of what wood God uſeth to frame his Saints. Do we not ſee oftentimes, that ſome eſcape out of Priſon by fire; others (falling into precipices very gently) have found their liberty in the bottom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; others, to whom poyſon hath turn'd into nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; others, to whom blowes of a Sword have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed life! by opening their Impoſtumes; yea often it is, that the ſeeds of good hap, are ſometimes hid under the appearances of evil. Oh ſilly humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then, which dareſt to row againſt the providence of God! finding us many precpices in thy paſſions, which ſeem ſo pleaſing to thee, as thou openeſt ſnares to betray thy poor ſoul!</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible that any, who bears the Name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſhould not be grieved to lead a life an Enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt? That ſo many good men, as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170557:90"/>we read of, ſhould by the power of virtue afflict their bodies, and preferre contempt above all that the world eſteemeth, that they might conform to the ſufferings of their Saviour, and any contentment ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, which comes not from divine things, and blots out all the memory of ſenſual delectations.</p>
               <p>Can it poſſibly be, that the Soul, which hath forſaken the Love-dalliances of the world, and razed out of his heart all other love (as the Rayes of the Sun ſcatter the Shadows and Phantaſms of the Night) ſhould any more delight in its former pleaſures? No ſure, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns (as from the Country of the dead) with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing voyce, and interrupted words, ſhe bedews her ſelf with tears for every vain thought and idle word, which offers violence, or makes the leaſt breach on her former engagement.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> avvaked (as it were out of a dead ſleep) after he had remained nine moneths covered with filth, and blood, without coming to himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Nathan</hi> took away that veil that blinded him; how ſoon did he become another man? He was no more that amourous <hi>David,</hi> but a Penitent exceedingly humbled; having a heart bleeding, eyes weeping, a ſad and disfigured face, a body made thin, ſighings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled one upon another; Joynts pined away with faſtings, and auſtereneſs, Bones broken, by reaſon of his ſin. Society was unpleaſing to him, the light unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him, becauſe reproaching him with his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. His Couch ſwam with Tears, his Harp was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in expreſſing his griefs, &amp; his whole Body (all this while dying to all mortal things of the earth) ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed his groanings, and ſwell'd with weeping on the Sea of Repentance, until he regained that preſence,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170557:91"/>from which he deſired God never more to caſt him.</p>
               <p>And oh, that we could but caſt thoſe eyes, which have ſo often deſcried the fair proſpects of the world upon Jeſus our Saviour, the true brazen Serpent to free us from the Serpents of Hell Fire! yea (O dear Saviour!) look back upon me, as thou didſt upon <hi>Peter!</hi> caſt thoſe eyes upon me, which did inceſſantly watch for my ſalvation, even to the paſſing of whole Nights in ſighs and Prayers! O caſt thoſe eyes of love, of mercy and compaſſion upon me, which dart the beams of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light into ſouls that love thee! Let thoſe eyes (which are always flouriſhing) cool &amp; ſhadow my wandering eyes, from the burning glances of luſtful concupiſence. Let thoſe eyes, which no ſooner began to exerciſe the functions of life, but were ſeen all in bloſſom, and an amourous aſpect for us, allay the ſpreading Rayes of thoſe open Caſements. Let thoſe eyes which from the top of a mountain, looked on a poor famiſhed people, who wander'd through the deſerts, as ſheep deprived of their ſhepherd, guid my ſtraying heart to thy own ſelf.</p>
               <p>Briefly, let thoſe chryſtal fountains, which daily diſtil the ſweet influences of mercies; which (in dropping tears) ſo freely poured out themſelves over miſerable <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> which prov'd ſo efficacious for us, when thou gav'ſt up thy Soul, with weeping, and bleeding in the Sacrifice of the Croſs, quench the flames of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy deſires, and abate the fervour of all ſinful thoughts and affections within us.</p>

               <head>The Soul [in a Phrenſey] breaks out into admiration of <hi>Gods love,</hi> in being freed from the miſery of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting flames.</head>
               <p>THe diſcourſe of Heavenly things, is the ſweeteſt <hi>Manna</hi> which the Soul taſteth in the wilderneſs
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170557:91"/>of this world. She is ever crying out, O Glory! O Bliſs! O Happineſs! how have ye ſtruck me to the heart? O when will the happy day come, that I ſhall ſit at this Fountain-head, and not need with pain, to draw the water of pleaſure? When ſhall I arrive at this ſweet Raviſhment and Extaſie? Alas! my dulneſs, my weakneſs, my drowſineſs? yea, ever and anon, is ſhe crying out! Oh the compaſſion of that Phyſitian; which finding his Patients in a Phrenſie, and knowing that nothing could preſerve their life, but the loſs of his own, is contented to die, not onely for thoſe who were the cauſers of his death, but the Actors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments themſelves!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, That Love is as ſtrong as death, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. But if we examine the ſtrength of each, we ſhal find Love to be the ſtronger. Its true, all earthly things ſubmit to the power of death; young and old, Kings and Peaſants, Scepters, and Spades, are all alike to him. Not the Supremacy of the King alſo; not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Prophet (as we ſee in <hi>David</hi>) not the gravity of the High Prieſt (verified in <hi>Eli</hi> to his Sons) Not the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or the ſtrength of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> are any way exempted from owing Homage, or paying tribute to Love, as unto Death.</p>
               <p>If we compare alſo, the acts of Love, with thoſe of Death; we ſhall find Love, not onely as powerful and univerſal, but much ſtronger; Death being only ſeen in taking the Rich, the Strong, the Wiſe, the Young, the Great: But O behold, how Love hath prevailed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Son of God, the Saviour, and life of the world! See how he ſubmitted himſelf to his death, out of Love! Was it not Love, and onely Love, that wreſtled with God, and overcame him in this, that he ſhould leave
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170557:92"/>the Heavens, and lay down his life, ſubmitting himſelf to that death which had no power over him?</p>
               <p>O my God what do I here ſee? what is this my eyes behold? Truly, my Lord, my God! death hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thee, even to Extaſie! Alas, what ſhall I ſay to thee? my heart overwhelming love! when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many Millions are ſwallowed up in Eternal perdition, while I am one of that ſmall number thou haſt brought to the light of knowing thee, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the narrow way to ſalvation? Why didſt thou ſet thine eyes upon me, preferring a wretch before ſo many thouſands? was it becauſe I was Nobler, or more excellent then they? Ah no!</p>
               <p>O my Soul! what doſt thou expect, if this be not enough to ſet thee on fire? Look about thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold yet a further endearment; ſee thy own Country, thy Neighbours, Acquaintance, thy Kindred, and Friends; yea, how many maiſt thou find of all degrees, more worthy of acceptation then thy ſelf? Oh how the Soul is fill'd with a Seraphick Love, with a fire drawn from the moſt pure flames of Heaven, which is unceſſantly burning (being ſhut up within a melting heart) without conſuming! and which like a Diamond, in the midſt of a thouſand Hammers, is never moved with all their violence; is never tempted with the glittering of Honours; but is alwayes tempering of Gall, with the moſt delicious contentments of this life, to follow her Jeſus, her wounded Jeſus, her Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that was crucified for her.</p>
               <p>Still is ſhe crying out to her ſelf, whence come thoſe Lights, thoſe Joyes, thoſe Pleaſures, Conſolations, and Hopes, which are thus above our ſtrength, and wherewith we often find our thoughts to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170557:92"/>and raiſed above our ſelves? Is it not from thee, O Jeſus! who enters into our Soul, and becomes our Comforter? we need not ſeek thee in Heaven, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art thus in our heart, and there uttereſt thy Oracles. O do thou ſtill raiſe us above all the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſences of fleſh! let us ever love and dilate our ſelves in thee, which thus filleſt us with the height of thy Glories! Let the ſweet familiarity we have with thee our Redeemer, ſteal from us all extraordinary care of the worlds employments; Though we are within the world, let us be nothing leſs then of the world. Let us (like Fiſhes) live ſilent in the roaring of the waves, and keep our ſelves freſhamidſt the brinywaters of the Sea of this world; yea, like the beams of the Sun, let us touch the Earth, but never leave Heaven.</p>
               <p>And ſince mercy provoked, changeth it ſelf into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Juſtice [and what Creatures then are there which will not puniſh a fugitive Soul, which flyes from her Saviour through her ingratitude, when he draws her to him by the ſweetneſs of his love.] O let me [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things] fear to be forſaken of thee, my God! O let not mine eyes be the ſnares of my Soul! Bleſſed Lord! thou haſt given thy ſelf for a portion, thy Son for a Ranſom, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. thy Spirit for a Pledge; thy Word for a Guide, and thy glorious Kingdom for an Inheritance: and alas, how unable am I to value the leaſt of thy bleſſings, much leſs to repay thee any thing for them; ſince I am infinitely below all thy mercies; and had I any thing worthy thy acceptance, it were all thine, and I could offer nothing to thee but thine own.</p>
               <p>What then ſhall I do, but throw my heart to the feet of thy bounty all naked, all melted, without ſelf-will,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170557:93"/>or povver of reſiſtance? <hi>Lord do thy pleaſure upon me,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.8. Howbeit I will not deſpair of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, vvhilſt I remember the Phyſitian. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi> Yea, I hope I am, even now, under thy healing hand. And though during my continuance in this Body, many infirmities oppreſs me, yet vvill I never leave craving what thou haſt taught me alvvayes to ask.</p>
               <p>Give me therefore a Gracious diſpoſition; a more watchful obedience to thy law, a more mortified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation for the future, and more ſorrow, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart for what is paſt. O let my eyes be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſee the ſhortneſs of the pleaſure of ſin, and the perpetuity of ſinners Torments; the eaſineſſe of thy gentle yoak, and light burden here below, and the weight of thy glory, provided for me above! ſince there is no moment (O Lord!) void of thy goodneſs; why ſhould there be any moment void of my praiſe?</p>
               <p>I know it will not be long until death conſume me to the very bones, and I ſhall then poſſeſs nothing, but what I have done for thee. Shall I then live in this world to my ſelf, and be ſtill vexed with care, how to preſerve a miſerable life? Dear Jeſus! ſuffer me not thus to be taught by thy Judgements, what I have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to learn from thy mercy. Time and age will one day wither the bloſſoms of youth. The beſt of our joyes are but fires of ſtraw, or flattering ſun-ſhines, which are ſuddenly either waſhed away with a ſhower, or baniſhed by Tempeſts. The Sun will (at laſt) da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the freſheſt Roſes, and Lillies. O let not then my thoughts ſtrike ſail, or my heart do homage to the tranſitory beauties of this world (which will onely enſnare and impriſon me in the Fetters of ſin) leaſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170557:93"/>the ſtorms of an evil conſcience ſuddenly ariſe, and trouble the ſerenity of my delights, and the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of my ſeeming felicity!</p>

               <p>AS Humility is ſeldome planted upon Crowns, and Scepters, ſo the wiſdom of State, ſeldome joyns with that of the Croſs, where its luſtre is too often darkned, by the too much glittering of the world and ordinarily finds ſlippery footing amongſt the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies and Diamonds of a Crown.</p>
               <p>It was the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flouriſhed two hundred years after the Nativity of our Saviour, when there had been no ſpeech of any Emperours that had embraced Chriſtianity;
<note place="margin">Tertul. in Apol.</note> 
                  <hi>That if the Caeſars would become Chriſtians, they would ceaſe to be Caeſars: and if the Chriſtians would become Caeſars, they would ceaſe to be Chriſtians;</hi> conceiving that poorneſs of ſpirit cannot conſiſt with ſo high and ſtately Riches, neither Humility with a Soveraign Empire, or the Tears of Repentance, with the vain delights of the Court.</p>
               <p>Surely, the hungring and thirſting after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs [upon which our Saviour ſo often leaves his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing] can no way ſtand with the deſire of Pomp, and Greatneſs in the world, no more then Peace can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with Licentiouſneſs of War, or pureneſs of heart, with the converſing with moſt pleaſing and tempting Beauties, or the faireſt hopes of the world, which are mowed dow in their flower, by the pittileſs Sythe of death. <hi>Peter</hi> was never ſo near his ruine, as when he

               <p>So hard is it alſo for Carnal eyes to behold the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Agony of our bleſſed Saviour; ſo hard is it for any Tongue (without being ſteeped in Gall) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his ſufferings, or for any perſon (without pouring out of Tears) to approach his Croſs. What eyes can look on thee as they ſhould, and behold all thy fleſh wholly imprinted with dolours, and thy heart drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in acerbities? What eyes can (without bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting) behold thy deadly ſweat of blood? can ſee thee dragg'd through the ſtreets of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> (eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one looking out at the windows to fill their eyes with gazing, and aſtoniſhment?) can ſee thee buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted, flouted, toſſed from one Tribunal to another; ſpit on every where, deſpiſed, and maliciouſly affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?

               <p>Behold, O my Soul! the whole life of thy Saviour, which he paſſed here on Earth, and thou ſhalt find it a School of Chriſtian manners; by the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof, <hi>Holineſs is perfected in the fear of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. The world loved Riches, but he would be poor. The world loved Honours, but he ſhun'd and refuſed a Kingdom, and the Treaſures thereof, the world delighted in a carnal off-ſpring, but he deſired neither Marriage not Iſſue. The world feared nothing more then diſgrace, deſertion of friends, inſulting of enemies, bodily Tortures, and Death; whereas Chriſt endured the rebukings of the people, the flight of his Diſciples, the mockings of the Souldiers, the ſpitting of the Jews, and the death of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>O vvonderful! that the mighty power of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity would thus manifeſt it ſelf in the infirmity of the Croſs! Sure it was onely for God to perform this great Deſign, and thus aſcend up to his Throne of Glory, by the baſeſt diſgraces of the world; and if vve vvill be his Children, vve muſt make it appear by participation of his Croſs, and by ſuffering Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By this Sun it is, that the Eagles are diſcovered.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170557:95"/>The good Thief ſaw no other Title, or ſign of his Kingdom, but onely his body covered over vvith bloud, and oppreſſed with dolours, by that Book of the Groſs, he learned all the Glory of Paradiſe, and apprehended, that none but God, could vvith ſuch patience endure ſo great Torments.</p>
               <p>Methinks (bleſſed Saviour!) I hear devout <hi>Simon</hi> (ſeeing thee heavy loaden with the burden of the Croſs) thus expoſtulating with thee. O Jeſus! vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeſt thou with the extream vveight of this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren piece of Wood? whether doſt thou carry it, and why? vvhere do you mean to ſet it; What? upon mount <hi>Calvary?</hi> Alas, that place is moſt wild, and ſtony! How canſt thou plant it there? who ſhall water it? to which thou anſwereſt; I bear indeed a piece of Wood upon my Shoulders, and carry it to mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> This Wood I bear, muſt bear me, to bear the ſalvation of the world, and to draw all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me. I bear it to place it by my death, and water it with my blood.</p>
               <p>Oh Love! canſt thou love more, or expreſs it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this? yet to all theſe, and infinitely more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and unſpeakable miſeries, was thy Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd [O my Soul! for thy ſake, for thine my ſoul!] that thou maiſt not complain, thou wanteſt an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a Motive, a Pattern, or invitation to love. O mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Love! Love it ſelf, Chriſt our Saviour! Hovv earneſt wert thou; nay, how delighted wert thou to Treat of thy <hi>Paſſion?</hi> It were thy ſweet words, not long before thy death, <hi>With deſire have I deſired to eat.</hi> And when S. <hi>Peter</hi> would have diſſwaded thee from thy laſt Sufferings, thou reprovedſt him more
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170557:95"/>for this, then for his denyal of thee in the High <hi>Prieſts</hi> Hall. Thou only caſtedſt thy eye upon him, for the firſt (as minding him thereby of his great promiſe made never to deny him;) but for the other, thou bidſt him avaunt; yea, call'ſt him Satan, as being the hinderer of thy much deſired and longed for death.</p>
               <p>Ah! incomparable Love! who can think on, and not admire the Extaſies of our ſweet Saviour? How is he even raviſhed with the object of his Death, and tranſported with the Idea of his ſufferings? Behold, how he encourageth himſelf in this combate? How troubled he is at all thoſe that hinder it? How confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doth he look on the Croſs, as the Fountain of his Glory? And ſhall we not love his Croſs, which Jeſus hath cheriſhed? every place is a Paradiſe to him that knows how to love the Croſs, and every thing a Hell to thoſe that fly it.</p>
               <p>Oh bleſſed Saviour then, who canſt lift up all the Earth, with the leaſt finger of thy power, raiſe up a little this ſinful maſs of my Body, which ſo ſadly weighs it ſelf down by its ſinnes! O my God, fix thine eyes upon me, and thou ſhalt thereby bring me to the fountain of true happineſs! The Father hath given me to thee, and I am the conqueſt of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud; and wilt thou ſuffer a Soul to be taken away from thee, that hath coſt thee ſo many ſweats and ſufferings? Alas, Lord! thou haſt but one life, and I ſee 1000 inſtruments of death, that have taken it away! Was there need of ſo many bloudy Doors to let out thy innocent Soul? Could it not part from thy Body, without making (on all ſides) ſo many wounds, which after they had ſerved for the Objects
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170557:96"/>of mens Cruelty, ſerve now for thoſe of thy mercy</p>
               <p>O Lance! cruel Lance! why didſt thou open his moſt tender ſide! But in thus playing the Murtherer, thou haſt made a Sepulchre, wherein I will from henceforth bury my Soul. When I behold the wounds of my dear Saviour, I do acknowledge the ſtroaks of my own hand, and will therefore likewiſe there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave my Repentance, Give me then (O ſacred mouth!) give me that Gall which I ſee upon thy lips, to ſprinckle all my pleaſures! divide with me, (O beautiful head!) thy dolorous Crown of Thorns, ſeeing it were my ſinnes which ſowed them! Lend me (O ſacred hands, and adored feet!) the Nails that have pierced them! and while I live, let me never breathe any other life, but that onely which ſhall be produced from my Crucified Saviour.</p>
               <p>Surely, we ſhall never be worthy of him, until we thus bear the Enſigns of his War, and Ornaments of our Peace. And alas! what reaſon hath wretched man to complain? Is not ſuffering our Trade, our Vow, our Profeſſion? As the Clock goeth on by the help of its counnter-poiſe, ſo a Chriſtians life never proceedeth ſo much in virtue, as by the counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of its Croſſes. Make me then to ſerve thee, to imitate thee; yea, to ſuffer for thee, O thou King of the afflicted! Ah, that I had a Sea of ſweet odours, to empty on an Object ſo worthy of love! Art thou unwilling to bear part of thy Saviours Croſs? yet give (O my Soul!) give at leaſt, tears to him, who ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for thy ſins!</p>
               <p>Conſider that thy [miſcalled] Sufferings, ifright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, are (indeed) Bleſſings. What if thou loſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170557:96"/>thy fortunes, it is to make thee know thy ſelf; what if thy Health be empaired, it will make thee diſaffect this world? What if thou loſe thy Riches,, is it not to make thee ſeek out better? By all which, God is pleaſed to ſhew us the ſtraighteſt way to that life, which he hath promiſed us; and to aſſure us by his own Tribulation [who could not but know and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace what is beſt] that the way of Tribulation, is the high-way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>We find (indeed) <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in one place thus complaining; <hi>Eternal Wiſdom! which thus cuts thy childrens Threats, and uſe them as Sacrifices, as if thou couldeſt not Crown them, but by their Torments, or Honour them, but by their puniſhments!</hi> But alas! he that will love, muſt ſerve.

               </p>
               <p>Oh foul confuſion of life, and proſtitution of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! God (who promiſeth never to behold us with a good eye, unleſs we keep his Commandments) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be loved above all things. Love that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer, is not Love. Yea, the laſt Character of love to our Saviour, is to ſuffer for him, the Prince of Sufferings. <hi>Our Souls are engaged by Oath</hi> (ſaith Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian) <hi>to this warfare, ſo ſoon as we firſt enter into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> Tertul. ad Scap.</p>
               <p>Beſides; know we not that all Creatures of the world groan, and bring forth; that all the Elements are in Travell, and in a ceaſeleſs agitation. The Air it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170557:97"/>ſelf (ſay the Philoſophers) is perpetually ſtruck with the motion of Heaven, to prevent the hatching of Poyſon. The Rivers are purified by their ſtreaming current. One deep muſt call upon another; the deep of Afflictions calls for that of Honour; and the heights of Honour are prepared according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Tribulations. In this world Cruelty is mingled with Lights, and Pleaſures with Funerals.</p>
               <p>Gods Priſon is a School of Wiſdome. In this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity are we free, under theſe Bonds and Irons, our Soul can walk with God, in the midſt of Groans, and ſighs, our heart can rejoyce, it can talk with him (though with the three Children in the midſt of the fiery Furnace.) And as the moſt rigorous of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, became a Throne of Honour to thoſe three Champions (the fire forgetting it ſelf to be fire, and the Furnace ſtrewing it ſelf with Roſes) ſo all the Thorny paths of our Pilgrimage here, ſeem but like a Meadow, enamelled over with Flowers. If we here make Jeſus the Object of our preſent Dolours, he will hereafter prove the Fountain of our Eternall Joyes.</p>
               <p>Behold then, the exact method which providence keeps, in the conduct of her choſen ones! Behold the Character of an humble Soul, perſecuted by the Tongues of Slanderers; by the Arms of his kindred; by the contempt of his friends, by the ingratitude of his Enemies; yea, of thoſe upon whom he had ſtill heaped good turns, without having the leaſt motion to revenge, alwayes rendering good for evil. And laſt of all, behold him pouring out Tears of joy, under his Saviours Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:170557:97"/>Here onely is the Sanctuary of reſt, where wearied Souls may lay their heads. Here ſhall we be ſure to meet with comfortable embraces. Here ſhall the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed live more contented, then Kings in their greateſt Royalty. Farewel Honours! farewel Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Riches, Reputation, Pleaſures, and gorgious Habiliments!

But welcome that Sickneſs, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; welcome thoſe Chains, Reproaches, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, yea Death it ſelf, which at laſt brings us aſleep under our Saviours Croſs.</p>
               <p>O happy Croſs! O welcome Troubles! why (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus!) ſhould I grieve to have thoſe ſhoulders wounded with ſuch a load, as (through thy aid) will become ſo pleaſant unto me? The world is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Sea, where uſually a Tempeſt doth ariſe, when a Calm is expected. But here's Conſtancy in a good courſe of life; Here's Patience in Tribulation; Here's Courage to ſupport injuries, and Comfort againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. O the poor Treaſures, that can be hoarded in Caves, in Houſes, in Towers! What proportion do they bear to this Heavenly Treaſure? O the ſcant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and jealous abſence, of all the Goods and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world! How fleeting and momentary are they? how changeable are their inclinations? how hungry are the Benefits, and how pinching their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalities? How baſe their Ends and aims, in their moſt real Profeſſions? how weak and frivolous their Paſſions? yea, how eaſily are all conſum'd in a few tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial diſtaſts?</p>
               <p>O my onely God! what miſerable, penurious blaſts
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170557:98"/>are theſe to blow the Coals of my love unto thee? Henceforth, for ever make me to run with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> after the ſweet odours of thy glorious preſence; make it all my pleaſure, to ſit dayes, nights, and hours, weighing the greatneſs of thy Excellency, the richneſs of thy Glory, and the beautifulneſs of thy Attributes. Make me to ſpend all my ſtrength in bleſſing thee for thy goodneſs, in rejoycing at thy Mercies, in admiring thy Juſtice, and adoring thy Truth, and in an awful Reverence of thy Eternal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>Thus doth the Soul (filled with Humility, and the zeal of Devotion) often (and not without groans) ſpeak unto her ſelf; What? ſhall I triumph where my Maſter hath been covered with Reproaches? Shall I take glory on my head, where my Saviour hath taken the Croſs upon his Shoulders? ſhall I adorn that head with Crowns of Pearl, where he received one of Thornes? No, O Jeſus! I have too long in deep draughts, drank of the poyſonous ſweets of this worlds alurements. Now will I hang all Honours at the feet of thy Croſs. What is Beauty, Strength, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Wiſdom, Induſtry, Eloquence, or all the things in the world, but Dung in compariſon of thy Croſs? O beloved Jeſus? there can I ſit, and condemn what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loever the world doth honour and eſteem.</p>
               <p>O my Saviour! what ſweetneſs and allurements are there in thy Sufferings? Here is our Wiſdome, our Juſtice, our Sanctification and Redemption; Here is the ſplendor of the celeſtial Father, and the Character of his ſubſtance, who by his Word, doth ſupport the world. And ſhall I not take up my Croſs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170557:98"/>and follow him, (as he hath commanded) amidſt the many great Affronts, Diſgraces, and Perſecutions, ſuffered by him? Shall I not therein alſo accompany his Prophets, the glorious company of his Apoſtles, and the Noble Army of Martyrs? Did my Saviour fly from Scepters, and run to the Croſs? would he have no worldly Kingdoms, becauſe their Thrones were made of Ice, and their Crowns of Glaſs, and ſhall I not believe, that where he is, there can be no Deſert or ſolitude?</p>
               <p>See, ſee then how the Characters of a ſuffering God, are the deareſt delights of a ſanctified Soul, which is no more it ſelf, but altogether transfigured with a heavenly tranſmutation! It lives wholly on the bloud of its Saviour; it breathes not, but by his ſpirit; it ſpeaks not, but by his words; it thinks not, but by his Meditations. It defies Tribulation, Anguiſh, Pain, Nakedneſs, and Dangers. It adventures amongſt bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Swords and Perſecutions, and is no way affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with burning Faggots, and boyling Cauldrons.</p>
               <p>And if thou (O my Soul!) art at any time unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with this Earthly Tabernacle, think but how willingly the glorious Martyrs of Chriſt ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelves in as many Torments as they had members. They preached on Croſſes, ſang in Flames, triumphed on Wheeles. Deſerts and Tears, Scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Snows, were nothing to them in the way to that Glory for which thou art unwilling to forſake a Dung-hil.</p>
               <p>But O my God! if thou think it fit to exerciſe my patience, to try my faith, to correct my ſin, by the wickedneſs of men, give me grave never to be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170557:99"/>with the injuſtice of Creatures, but that I may conſider the juſtice of thee, who art the moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creator! O let me not be vanquiſhed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the burden of the Croſs, but rather ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the weight of it, to walk more ſteadily in all holineſs, Juſtice, and ſobriety, before thee.</p>
               <p>And though Affliction here ſeem like the Cloud, which the Prophet ſaw to carry winds and ſtorms in it [but was environed with a golden Circle] yet let it, at laſt, be encompaſſed with the brightneſs, and ſmiling felicity of that day, wherein Calumny ſhall change it ſelfe into Adoration, Rage into aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe that are thought loſt in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of miſery, ſhall ſee themſelves conſecrated, and carried through their puniſhments, into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Eternal ſafety!</p>
               <p>Be not diſmayed then, (O faithful Soul!) in the Sufferings and troubles of this life! ſuffer not thy ſelf to be overcome with thoſe Temptations, which will ſnatch ſo rich a Crown out of thy hands! Happy, and for ever bleſſed wilt thou be to enter into ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a Glory! vvhen it ſhall be ſaid unto thee (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the Deſerts of this world) come now, and dwell in the everlaſting delights of thy God! O throw away thoſe vanities which too much, too much flattered thee, with the ſplendors of a deceitful world! Raiſe up thy ſelf, and ſay; O when will that day come, which will reſtore me a body to render it to God; a body no longer of frail pondorous and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable Earth, but a body immortal, and gilded with the ſplendors and ſufferings of my Saviour!</p>
               <p>Yea, let us more fix our Thoughts on an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170557:99"/>a Reſurrection, an Eternal Life; a life of God gained for us, by the pains, ſweats, and blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to which he daily invites us; a life which will charm all our Troubles, ſweeten all our rigours, purifie all our intentions, animate our virtues, and at laſt (after ſo many hardſhips and Travels of a wretched life, ſo many Calumnies and Reproaches, and after ſo great a Tumult of miſeries) Crown us with happineſs, reſt our weather beaten Ark, and bring us into a ſweet and quiet repoſe.</p>

               <p>THe Soul of Man can hardly entertain any Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods will, but that wherein its own is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. It is uſually more troubled for any chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then for its ſin; yea, it often mourns for ſin, rather becauſe it deprives her of comfort, then becauſe it provoketh God: Nay, how hardly can it embrace his word, with that joy, and his providence, with that contentment, as to ſay [at all times] with patient <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas! vvhat patience hath it in committing ſinne; but how impatient in ſuffering for it? how ready to execute vice; but how unwilling to endure the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

He that deſires the ſociety of Angels, muſt not embarque himſelf deeply in worldly affairs: God is a Spirit, and he that intends to receive good from him, muſt not be a ſlave to his Body. He that intends to find Chriſt, muſt ſearch for him [as the three Kings did] in the Manger of his Humility; he muſt look for him [as the bleſſed Virgin did] in the Temple in his piety; yea, he muſt ſeek for him [as the <hi>Maries</hi> did] in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, in the imitation of his death:</p>
               <p>But where (O Saviour! ſhall I begin thy paſſion? ſhall I go with thee into the Garden? indeed there it begun; there it was, that thy <hi>Soul began to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful even unto the death.</hi> There it was that thou beggeſt, <hi>That the Cup might paſs from thee, Mat.</hi> 26.38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There it was that thou ſweatedſt in a cold night on the Ground, in a cold Garden; yea, there it was that thoſe drops of blood which ſo freely iſſued from thy veins, were forthwith congealed with the Air.

               <p>But ſhall we follow thee from the Garden into the High <hi>Prieſts</hi> Hall? O how hideous were the outcryes of the rude Rabble againſt thee! Ah Lord! what was that vvhich ſtopped thy ear, that thou wouldſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; or ſilenced thy Tongue, that thou wouldſt not reply, was it not thy Love?

               </p>
               <p>Unfortunate Sons of <hi>Adam!</hi> the effects of whoſe fond diſobedience are now become ſo ſadly evident! Behold thy Saviour caſt on the Ground, his knees bent, his eyes over-flown with Tears; his Hands ſtretched up towards Heaven [all covered with gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Clouds, and darkneſs] his heart ſwoln with grief, and is ready to break into ſome loud and doleful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt mans Ingratitude. O my God! what means this univerſal ſtrife, and contention within thy own breaſt? Art thou daunted at the ſight of danger? Is the ſight of danger become ſo frightful to thee? Thou weepedſt indeed over <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> drew Tears from thy eyes, but not with ſuch aſtoniſhment as this.</p>
               <p>Thou diſcourſedſt of thy <hi>Paſſion</hi> on mount <hi>Tabor</hi> but with a Glory which raviſhed the eyes and hearts of all that beheld it; thou haſt often profeſt a great deſire to ſee the hour of thy ſuffering; and can horror poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſeize on thee? Can grief ſurround thee? cold and ſtupifying Tears poſſeſs thee, now thou art arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo near the place of thy wiſhes? O no! thy great Deſign is to be tempted in all things without ſinne, that we might be comforted in the tremblings and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170557:101"/>faintings of our heart, and that we might learn this great and difficult Leſſon, how to comfort our ſelves at the full Tide of anguiſh and Tribulations.</p>
               <p>Behold further (O my Soul!) what a glorious Leſſon of Patience thy Saviour hath ſet before thy eyes! Bend but thy ears to thoſe ſacred words, <hi>Not my will, but thine be fulfilled:</hi> and who would think but that the exceſs of grief ſhould a little diſturbe thy memory? Thou fore-ſaw'ſt [no queſtion] Bleſſed Saviour! thoſe Clubs and Lantherns, Souldiers, and Officers, prepared to lay hands upon thee, and with loud cryes and ſcorns to carry thee to <hi>Hieruſalem. Hieruſalem,</hi> where thon hadſt done ſo many miracles. <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where thou ſo lately enteredſt with Joy and Triumph; and yet, <hi>thou cryedſt thy will be done!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou well kneweſt that Judges of all ſorts, Prieſts and Divines, and Religious men which daily miniſtred at thy. Holy Altar, were appointed to diſcredit and accuſe thee. That Kings, and Preſidents, Jews, and Gentiles, and an infinite number aſſembled at this great Feaſt, would ſcorn and condemn thee, and yet ſtill <hi>thou cryedſt, thy will be done!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It was no news to thee, that a Murtherer ſhould be preferred before thee, and begg'd in thy place by thy beloved People, amongſt whom thou ſpentſt

               </p>
               <p>Thou ſaweſt afore hand, thy weeping and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Mother ſtand at the foot of thy Croſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting thy departing Soul, with the ſight of thy grief and diſconſolate condition thou leaveſt her in; and laſt of all, that thou ſhouldſt be abandoned on all hands, and not ſo much as thy lifes laſt breath ſpared. O invincible Courage! O admirable Fortitude! which neither life, nor death, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor fears, nor torments, could ſo far alter thy reſolution, but ſtill thou ſubmitteſt in theſe words, <hi>Thy will be done, Lord! and not my own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas! Is there no remedy after all this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for thy bleſſed Soul? Muſt thou alone drink of this ſower Cup?

Alas deareſt Saviour! where is then the God of <hi>Elias?</hi> Are his bowels of mercy turn'd into Adamant? are the Eternal Springs of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon</hi> dryed up? are the Heavens become Iron, that no drops of dew can diſtill down to refreſh thy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Soul? Where are now thy old friends, which were ſo much delighted with thy Glory upon mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> who lately ſung ſo cheerfully at thy entering into <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> yea, even ſolemnly proteſted their readineſs to die with thee! Alas! they are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep! ſo faſt, ſo dead aſleep, that neither ſhame nor
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170557:102"/>compaſſion on their Maſters diſconſolate condition, can make them to ſay ſo much as one ſhort prayer for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Oh weak condition of humane friendſhip! unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and miſerably deluded are all they who build on ſo falſe a Bottom! How far better is it to truſt in God then Man? O ill requited Maſter! is this the fruit of all thy Teachings? Is this thy reward for all thy Benefits? Is this the Profit of all thy Wonders thou haſt made amongſt them? What though <hi>Judas</hi> were tempted with the glittering of Silver, which dazels the eyes of all the World; yet what Plea have thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciples to excuſe their dulneſs, their cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of Love? Though Earth fail, Heaven ſhould be kind.</p>
               <p>And now, O my Soul! thou who haſt been witneſs to this great Spectacle; What? ſhall not this ſtrange and incomparable love of thy Saviour, make thee wholly to go out of thy ſelf? Look [if thou are able to look at ſo glorious a Light, or judge of ſo infinite charity] and tell me what thou canſt do? Canſt thou love any thing after this, but thy Lord Jeſus? Canſt thou affect any thing but thy dear Saviour? Can thy greateſt troubles or hardſhips diſtaſte thee? Thou complaineſt indeed of thy Sufferings, but weigh them in this Ballance; and alas! how little cauſe haſt thou to complain?</p>
               <p>Ah! what poor flea-bitings are thoſe which thou art afflicted with, in reſpect of the Torments thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour underwent for thee? whom thou thus ſeeſt to have traced out the way with his own gored footſteps; having his Head Crown'd with Thorns, his ſhoulders
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170557:102"/>charg'd with the infamous Burden of the Croſs; his ears pierced with Reproachful ſpeeches, and his eyes floating with Tears; in which condition he aſcended mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and invites thee to follow him.</p>
               <p>Were they not thy ſins (O my Soul!) which were the Nails that faſtned his Hands, and his Feet? were they not the Spears which pierced his ſacred ſide? Look upon thy Hypocriſie, which was the kiſs that betrayed him? Behold thy Back-ſlidings, which made his Soul weary to death, which cauſed the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment of his Fathers love, and made him cry out that he was forſaken? Hath Chriſt endured ſo much for thee, and wilt thou not ſuffer a little for him? Ah happy is that Affliction which is raiſed from thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours love! How rich ſhall we be, when we have him for our Portion? yea, how high, when we ſhall ſee a true contempt of the world under our feet?</p>
               <p>Maiſt thou forbid (O bleſſed Jeſus!) that I ſhould go about any worldly Throne, which carries not thy Scepter, or that I ſhould talk of Honours, when there is mention made of thy Holy Croſs! Let all great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where thou art, not be baſeneſs unto me; and let me mount up unto thee by thoſe ſtairs of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby thou cameſt down to me. O let me kiſs the paths of that Mount, which thou haſt ſprinkled with thy precious Bloud, and eſteem that Croſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all earthly things, which thou haſt conſecrated by thy cruel pains!</p>
               <p>Alas! is it not a ſhameful thing that God ſhould ſeek us, among the heats of his Love and Sufferings, and yet we cannot be found by him? Shall we not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all the Diſorders of a ſenſual life, which hinder
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170557:103"/>the effect of his Grace? ſhall we not (with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> woman) forſake, and leave behind us our Pitcher, that we may return full of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> ſhall we not bid farewel to all thoſe occaſions which lead us to ſin? O dear Saviour (the moſt pure of all Beauties!) ſince it is for thee that ſo many Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have peopled Deſerts, and paſſed the ſtream of bitterneſs and ſorrow, bearing their Croſſes after thee, and (amongſt the moſt cruel of dolours) have felt the ſweetneſs of thy preſence! ſhall I ſhed no Tears for thoſe ſins that pierced thee? ſhall Jeſus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo many Thorns upon his Head, and ſhall I have none in my heart?</p>
               <p>Alas, my Soul! canſt thou behold a Crown of Thorns grafted upon a man of ſorrow? what Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle alas, is this? no more a man, but a skin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled, and bloody, taken from the teeth of Tigers and Leopards! Every ſtroak made a wound, every wound a fountain of blood. O hideous Prodigies which took away from us the light of the Sun, and covered the Moon with a ſorrowful darkneſs! Heaven wears mourning upon his Croſs; all the Citizens of Heaven weep over his Torments. The Earth quakes, the Stones rend, the Sepulchres open, the Dead ariſe; and all to teach us [by inſenſible Creatures] the pitty we ſhould take of his Sufferings!</p>
               <p>And, in concluſion of all, what ſhould we hence learn, but [imitating our bleſſed Saviour, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>ſadneſs in his Soul even to death;</hi> yea, taking up a reſolution and deprecation in the approaches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me</hi>] willingly to ſubmit to all thoſe Sufferings
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170557:103"/>he ſhall think fit to lay upon us. Neither to be any way fearful or ſolicitous, in what manner God will pleaſe to take us to him; or in the leaſt manner to be troubled touching the place, hour, or manner of our Diſſolution, ſince he that made us, beſt knows how to diſpoſe of us as he pleaſe, who can give us a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial in our greateſt fainting Fits; and therefore his will ought to be the rule of our Life, and Death, our Sufferings, and our Sorrows, ſince from him [who is all goodneſs of himſelf] we cannot expect any thing but the beſt.</p>
               <p>Are we mortal, and ſhall we grieve to die? Shall we not gladly drink of that Cup, whereof our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath begun? Death is unwelcom onely to thoſe who have not mortified their deſires and affections, here while they lived; why then ſhould we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret to leave ſo miſerable a liſe? Why ſhould we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to bid adieu and quit this place, where we have endured ſo many Deaths, and which hath ſo long been the place of our ſorrows?</p>
               <p>O my God! what a vain fear then is that which ſtartles me? what a ſad Penſiveneſs which over-ſpreads me? Oh when, and where ſhall I take my flight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee! Do not tell me (O dear Saviour!) there is a great Chaos between thee, and me, ſince thou haſt already paſſed it; and wilt thou not then lift me up by thy mercy? I am here (as within the Deſerts of <hi>Africa</hi>) in a burning world, the drought whereof makes it a habitation for Devils. O my God! I am tormented in this flame, until ſome <hi>Lazarus</hi> be found to dip the end of his finger in thy blood, to allay the burning of my thirſt, and reſtore me into the boſome of a merciful God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:170557:104"/>O beſſed day! when we ſhall be free from ſorrow, and ſuffering, but not from comfort, where we ſhal reſt from our Labours, and perfectly injoy the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God; who, as he is love it ſelf, will perfectly love us, yea love us for ever. O comfortable words! how ſweet muſt they needs be to our ears? how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to our wearied Senſes, and languid Spirits?</p>
               <p>Ah, What ſmiles ſhall we then perceive in that face of Sorrows [and with whom we have here ſuffered] when he ſhall pronounce that joyful ſentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father;</hi> ſhal we then repent our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sorrows? are not the Tears of Repentance ſweet unto us? This is that joy which was procured by ſorrow. This is that Crown which was procured by the Croſs. Jeſus did weep, that our Tears might be waſhed away. Our Saviour bled, that we might not be wounded. O bleſſed Love! Oh, in what a frame will our Soul then be! who can expreſs? who can conceive the infinite love, and unexpreſſible joy of ſo happy a Union, ſo ſweet a Reconcilement! who can queſtion the love, which he doth ſo ſweetly taſte? or doubt of that, vvhich vvith ſuch joy he feeleth, vvhen vve ſhall be incircled in Eternity, and for ever praiſe him.</p>
